A refusal from those in power to address the growing, gaping divide in the West between native European populations (mostly conservative/right) and 1st and 2nd generation migrant populations (mostly left) is what is driving Europe's-shift to the right, along with a form of censorship, where people don't feel they can talk about immigration of the problems that come with so many new people with so many new (and sometimes incompatible) cultures, without being labeled as a bigot or a racist, therefore shutting down any honest debate. It seems to me that the left has no solution to this fractured society. I can't see myself voting right, as I think this might just deepen the divide, but I also feel the left has no plan for how to tackle this.",

Now, like you said, at 500 ppm CO2e, it's only realistic to see the future as an empty place. Clearly, hope isn't motivating people to change, and why do we deserve to hope if we're on track to go extinct and take everything else with us? If you're on a sinking boat that's also on fire, acting like everything is ok and doing nothing is the worst possible response. Hope should be the reward for putting out the fire and getting the sinking under control, not a default position we take to comfort ourselves in the flames. I will be very happy to hope for the future when there's a future to hope for. Hell, I'll even feel hopeful if our emissions level off, but so far that hasn't happened. There has been no change in the overall situation other than it getting worse. I refuse to entertain the delusion that things will get better because they've been good before and I'm tired of that being the expectation. Yesterday, it went from spring with no snow on the ground, to winter with snow on the ground in an hour. How many times can these deep freezes happen before life emerging from its protective cocoons is too vulnerable to survive? This is how we get spring fires and forests of suddenly dead trees. All I hear from everyone around here is \"I wish winter would go away\" and I can only respond with \"It did. It was spring. This is not normal, and neither was our winter\" which was warm until recently, when we started getting the deep cold we'd normally get in january. Life is not adapted to this! It can't be. In addition, I've seen this up close. It's hard to hope for a future when you've seen the edge. We're SOOOO unaware of the health of the world. All these animals turning up in suburban yards are not being friendly, they're starving and escaping an empty forest. That video of the dear running up to the hunter was very clearly a dear looking for food and willing to take the risk. Soon it will be predators. If you live in the north, keep an eye out for polar bear movement coming south. There are so many of them!

        "comment_text": "I had recently gotten out of school; I lived in NYC and worked for a nonprofit organization. The economic crisis hit us immediately like a ton of bricks. Within days after Lehman and AIG collapsed, we got letters from two major foundations saying they could no longer fulfill the six-figure grants they had awarded us months earlier. One of these foundations, coincidentally, was almost entirely invested in (and may have been related to) AIG. It was a huge foundation, and if I'm not mistaken, it ceased to exist soon. As the days went on, numerous major donors contacted us to say they had to pause all their giving, and we knew that for every person who called there were 10 more who just weren't going to write us a check. Within one week, I came in to the office and my boss grabbed me, pulled me into a conference room, and started by saying \"I just need you to know that your job is safe for now....\" but we were laying off about 1/5 of our staff. A few weeks later we laid off another 1/5. Several of our peer organizations folded within a month or two, realizing the cliffs they were facing. I was so down about what happened to NYC that I started actively looking for jobs elsewhere. By the following March I was offered a job in Oregon, and I took it almost without hesitating. This turned out to be one of the best decision I ever made! In Oregon the crisis was obviously still an issue but it was so, so, so much less \"in your face\" than in NYC. So in the end, while it was stressful and upsetting, I was fine. I didn't lose my job, I was like 25 so I didn't have any serious investments to worry about, and the crisis directly led to me moving to a place I love and still live.",

I don't think this desire would be completely foreign to your girlfriend either although I can see how there could be some conflicting emotions that could confuse her. I think this could be largely avoided if you prepared a list of how living on your own would benefit the relationship in the long run, this way you are showing her that this is not a decision you are taking lightly and that you have your future with her in mind when you are thinking about this. Some of the benefits I would expect you could gain from living alone is that you get a better appreciation of how much work goes into maintaining a clean home, you certainly wouldn't want to move in together and end up constantly fighting about \"that mess in the corner\" or some such. You also get an appreciation for cooking and grocery shopping, setting your own budget for all these new expenses and managing your time on your own. I'm sure there are more things I'm forgetting, basically think of all the responsibilities your parents and grandparents help to take care of at home, you don't want to move out without having experience taking on those responsibilities yourself. I think Euchris's idea of a deadline could help however as you mention you may still not feel ready to move in together and you don't want to feel like you've broken a commitment so instead of a deadline I would say schedule fairly regular check ins where you and your girlfriend will sit down and talk about how you're both feeling about moving in again.

        "comment_text": "Sorted arrays are processed faster than an unsorted array, due to a phenomena called branch prediction. The branch predictor is a digital circuit (in computer architecture) trying to predict which way a branch will go, improving the flow in the instruction pipeline. The circuit/computer predicts the next step and executes it. Making a wrong prediction leads to going back to the previous step, and executing with another prediction. Assuming the prediction is correct, the code will continue to the next step. A wrong prediction results in repeating the same step, until a correct prediction occurs. The answer to your question is very simple. In an unsorted array, the computer makes multiple predictions, leading to an increased chance of errors. Whereas, in a sorted array, the computer makes fewer predictions, reducing the chance of errors. Making more predictions requires more time. Sorted Array: Straight Road ____________________________________________________________________________________ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT Unsorted Array: Curved Road ______ ________ | |__| Branch prediction: Guessing/predicting which road is straight and following it without checking ___________________________________________ Straight road |_________________________________________|Longer road Although both the roads reach the same destination, the straight road is shorter, and the other is longer. If then you choose the other by mistake, there is no turning back, and so you will waste some extra time if you choose the longer road. This is similar to what happens in the computer, and I hope this helped you understand better. Also I want to cite @Simon_Weaver from the comments: It doesn’t make fewer predictions - it makes fewer incorrect predictions. It still has to predict for each time through the loop...",

These sorts of situations can be pretty annoying and, hopefully if you're in the opposite position you'll interrupt your friend at an opportune moment and introduce the unknown party to them but, failing that (as in your situation), you should do this yourself. Hi, friend! I'm anongoodnurse and this is partner. How are you doing this evening? How do you know [friend couple]? [Optional: We were just having a nice discussion of {discussion topic}. Would you care to join us?] Usually making yourself a part of the situation will bring you to their attention as not being willing to sit idly by during a lengthy conversation, which is incredibly rude of them. A quick \"hi\" and \"bye\" is one thing and many people don't interrupt with the intention of a long conversation but by adding yourself to the equation, you make them less likely to ignore you. This will also hopefully give your friends the chance to do their job of saying: \"It's really great to see you but this isn't the best time as we're dining with anongoodnurse and spouse. Let's catch up some other time.\" ... which, as I said, is what the friends should have done in the first place and what we should all try to do if in this situation. Hopefully by being active they'll realize that they're interrupting, which is why the optional part is in there - to make them aware that they've interrupted a conversation - and passively encourage them to realize that they're being rude. This may not work every time but once you've added yourself to the conversation, you can gradually become more pointed in your interruptions encouraging them to move along. Sadly, some people simply can't take a hint and will keep going until they're done regardless. If you feel like you're in this situation because they show no indication of stopping after you introduce yourself, you can use a variation of what your friends should have said to hopefully get them to move on. Yes, it's a bit rude to go this route but sometimes when they're refusing to accept the subtle hints, you've got to either be the carpet for them to walk on or pull it out from under them. I'm sorry to interrupt, friend, but is your interruption going to last much longer? We're trying to have a conversation over dinner but you've been here chatting for five/ten/fifteen minutes now.

This has an inherent implication that every one else has made the wrong choice. The problem is that you do believe you have made the right choice. You're not trying to force that on other people. In fact, it appears that you are much more careful about that then most of us are on a day to day basis. So how do you communicate the truth as you understand it, without making everyone else feel that you are implying that they have made the \"wrong\" decision? Answer: Use humor. Be careful: you don't want to make the meat eater the butt of the joke, but rather make yourself the butt of the joke. Full disclaimer: I could not think of any jokes that fit this criteria. (But then, I'm not that funny of a guy.) Be more specific. Focus your explanation on you, and keep it as short as you can. For example: Eating another animal's body parts feels gross to me. I don't like the idea of an animal being killed for me to eat. These two examples focus on disgust and guilt which you feel. While most people don't agree with your choice, they will be able to empathize with those feelings of disgust or guilt, which should (cross your fingers) help them connect with you rather than feel resentful toward you.

        "comment_text": "Here in germany , children are taught explicitly not to point at people, but there are situations where it is entirely acceptable. My take at this is that it depends mostly on whom you point at: the one you talk with /to (grammatically: second person) or a third person whom you talk about , and whether there is aggression in the gesture. From your description of the situation, I'd have guessed it acceptable. Rude why is it that society finds it rude to point at people? What's the harm in doing that? The \"3rd person pointing\", i.e., pointing at someone else whom you are talking about with your colleague is frequently considered rude. I'd say that the underlying reason is because gossiping about a third person is rude. So when this pointing gesture is considered a symptom of such gossip, it is likewise considered rude. The 2nd-person pointing (you), as others have pointed out, may be perceived as aggressive. The extreme of this would be to get very close to the one you are talking to (= intruding into their personal space) and actually tapping their chest (= violating their personal space even more). That would be considered the beginning of physical aggression. Acceptable use while I was talking, I was also pointing at them (it was an unconscious way of emphasizing the \"you\" part) Another situation is when someone is far away and surrounded by multiple people. In those instances, I find it really useful to be able to point in order to tell someone else \"here is the person we are looking for/talking about\". (the person I am pointing may or may not be able to hear what I am saying.) This would be entirely OK in Germany. German sign language uses pointing with the index finger for you . The same gesture is used by many people (even without knowing that it is actually the official sign), e.g. in noisy environments as in your example or in situations where one should not make disruptive noise. Some notes related to autism: You may find environments too noisy to understand other people where others still understand fine. Others thus may not realize that the environment is noisy for you; and you may Hawkins may not know where their too noisy/not being able to hear&understand starts. If possible, I'd recommend asking the co-worker as well whether they perceived the pointing as rude. Depending on whether your boss and co-workers know about your autism, or whether you are fine with telling them explicitly about particular difficulties you have and what helps you communicating, I'd think it entirely reasonable to let them know that you have difficulty understanding already in moderately noisy environments (if that is the case). In other words, that it may help you if they use more gestures. And that gestures help you communicating, e.g. making unambiguously clear who the you is that you ask to help with the task. You could also try whether you can replace the pointing with the other's name (\"X, could you please do the task\" rather than \"Could you [point] please do the task\").",

Generally: Use words that relate to you, not to others. Use words that are specific and do not imply judgement. Unfortunately ethical does not belong to those. Use words that are detailed.

But on occasions when I have passengers, I often forget to turn the volume down and sometimes I get complaints - back seat passengers complain that it is too loud, my mother goes as far as immediately turning the volume down to almost inaudible. I don't have any special audio equipment in the car, it is that model's usual factory fitted unit; and I don't drive with the volume up to 11 and the door panels vibrating :-). But the truth is, I just don't appreciate how loud it can seem to other people. It sounds \"normal\" to me. I only really noticed it a few years ago when I left the music on and had cause to climb in the back seats, and yes, it seemed much louder than from the driver's seat.

        "comment_text": "Being autistic myself, I have embraced it as a slightly humorous, nerdish persona; people (correctly) don't feel they understand what autism is like, but they are comfortable with the idea of nerds - being a nerd is mildly cool, somehow. Nerds come in all walks of life, usually being people who are very good at concentrating on subjects, if they aren't disturbed, and often nearly obsessive with specialised subjects; for me it is mathematics (category theory, if you must know - I can bore most people to tears), but it may be anything. So, tell people you're a nerd, and they are more likely to accept that there are things about you they don't understand - and don't need to understand; they just need to accept it, really. Edit So, examples - I'm not too sure about this, actually; you see, being what I am is just natural from my point of view. I have lived more than 60 years now, and I have developed from embracing loneliness to learning to accept and sometimes even enjoy social contact, but slowly; I still find it very hard work going to a party - there are just too many things going on, and nobody who who would be interested in talking about things I find immensely fascinating. My exact ways of coping with life are not universally relevant - autists are probably more diverse than most, the reason being that what I for lack of a better word call \"normal people\" have a natural tendency to be like others, follow fashion etc, whereas autists most often don't become part of the flock - so we diverge. However, I think there is a core of shared experience, and the divergence happens as a result of whichever interests we pick up along the way. I grew up hearing a lot of Danish, working class humour with quite rough edges, and one thing I have learned to use with some success is humour - and \"nerdishness\" is a form of humour, I think - and I think autists more often than the average have a wild imagination; I personally have had to rein that in a lot, because otherwise people simply don't know what I'm talking about. As an example, a colleague once came to my desk, looking a bit thoughtful; my attempt at being funny was \"Ah, you've come to gloat, have you?\" - I think I had just read some funny story about conspiracies, but he looked absolutely stricken. Of course he had no way of understanding my context, and I still feel bad about it. Now, I would probably have said something more like \"You look worried - how can I depress you further?\" - I think that might work; I have found that injecting a bit of consideration for others in what I say often helps. I think what I have found most useful is my own brand of absurd humour (as long as I don't go over the edge); often plays on words, often stating obvious nonsense as Absolute Truth, and with great authority. An example of the first would be something like \"Are you finished? No, I'm Danish\", of the latter things like \"Have you got any morals? Good heavens, man, what are you talking about - of course not!\" or \"Do you like children? Mmm, yes\". As I said, I was marked by my childhood. Finally, why do I think \"embracing your inner nerd\" is a good idea, at least if you have autism? Well, firstly it is about accepting what you are - being autistic, you are not likely to be the life of the party, but you probably have an immense capacity for learning - not just within one's own, narrow obsession, but just about any subject - and enjoying it. Most things can be learned, and interpersonal skills are, well, just skills, which can be learned, even if it comes hard. Secondly, there seems to be a trend at the moment for \"nerd cool\" - I don't understand what that is about, but lack of knowledge has never stopped people in the past; so you might as well reap the benefit. Nerd chique is of course just a shallow fashion, but you are the real thing.",
