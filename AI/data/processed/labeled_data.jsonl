{"comment_text":"I think your desire to live on your own is completely understandable, I was in a similar situation until a few years back when I moved out of my parents and bought my own place. I don't think this desire would be completely foreign to your girlfriend either although I can see how there could be some conflicting emotions that could confuse her. I think this could be largely avoided if you prepared a list of how living on your own would benefit the relationship in the long run, this way you are showing her that this is not a decision you are taking lightly and that you have your future with her in mind when you are thinking about this. Some of the benefits I would expect you could gain from living alone is that you get a better appreciation of how much work goes into maintaining a clean home, you certainly wouldn't want to move in together and end up constantly fighting about \"that mess in the corner\" or some such. You also get an appreciation for cooking and grocery shopping, setting your own budget for all these new expenses and managing your time on your own. I'm sure there are more things I'm forgetting, basically think of all the responsibilities your parents and grandparents help to take care of at home, you don't want to move out without having experience taking on those responsibilities yourself. I think Euchris's idea of a deadline could help however as you mention you may still not feel ready to move in together and you don't want to feel like you've broken a commitment so instead of a deadline I would say schedule fairly regular check ins where you and your girlfriend will sit down and talk about how you're both feeling about moving in again. This way you're not breaking any commitment if you're not ready and shows that you don't want this to be a closed conversation.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"20193","post_title":"How to politely tell my girlfriend that I want to live on my own for some time","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/20193","timestamp":"2018-12-07T12:27:13","char_len":"1823","word_len":"327","lang":"en","label":"positive"}

I am a high school science teacher in Northern Virginia and any time I try to teach my point of view on this subject, administration starts getting complaints and of course comes to me with warnings. Unless you're an expert climatologist teaching a course on your specialty, your point of view isn't what you're tasked with teaching. Your job is to educate people on current scientific consensus. >The Earth changes temperatures over time, what about the ice age? If we were around back then would people be trying to fill the atmosphere with as much carbon dioxide as possible? We might have done so, yes. An ice age would result in catastrophic changes to human civilization. And, yes, the Earth changes temperatures, but there is a highly convincing correlation between the rate of change we've observed and the emissions resulting from the industrialization of human civilization. >I'm nearly 44 years old and I've yet to notice a significant change in the weather or temperature. We're talking about a scale of time larger than your particular lived experience. Also, are you taking measurements with highly calibrated instruments each year? [These people](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20020919/), for instance, have been. And they've determined that from 1951-2000, the Earth's surface \"has warmed by about .5ÂºC (0.9ÂºF) while the upper atmosphere (10-15 mile altitudes) has cooled by about 1ÂºC (1.8ÂºF).\" >I live in Virginia, and yes people keep bringing up Hurricane Florence, but I've been here a long time and heavy rains and hurricanes are nothing new. It still gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter, we still get snow and rain, and overall everything seems perfectly normal. Again, you're just spouting your personal experience as though it refutes amassed empirical data. >Despite this it seems to get nearly constant media attention, especially when states like California decide to ban plastic straws or other such stunts. California didn't \"ban plastic straws.\" They made it illegal for business to provide them automatically to customers to curb the associated waste. And the goal here has nothing to do with climate change, but with curbing litter and plastic pollution. >However, lately my daughter has been vehemently insisting that climate change is in fact very real, and very dangerous. Because she had a responsible teacher her who informed her of the scientific consensus. >I told her I don't believe in it and I don't teach my students about it This is supremely unethical and, if you ask me, you should be fired.

{"comment_text":"OP here, with an update: Almost six weeks have passed now. The problem is going to resolve itself for me, but not in a very satisfying way. I am switching customers while continuing work for the same company, and I will soon be taking a different/no train each day. There were some suggestions of trying to make other small talk. I notified the male from church, and tried this for about a week. That week was no fun at all! So in this case, that definitely did not work. But I really liked the idea, and I afterwards was very glad I tried it first. So I kicked aside all my nerves, and asked three complete strangers if they were just as bothered by this as me. I bonded together with three other females, we exchanged phone numbers and devised a plan of attack. We made some video of the bad behaviour, and started reporting every incident via twitter (private messages) to the train's customer service. We went again to his parents, and showed them the video. They were quite shocked. We left some video material with them, and they promised to confront their son about it and get more help for him. I felt bad about this the whole time, but am glad afterwards glad I started doing something. We are completely ignoring him if he is talking in the silence carriage, and one of us leaves to get train personnel, explains the situation on the way and we always succeeded in having him removed. Ignoring him seems to be helping more than telling him to shut up, sometimes he now even leaves when we threaten to stand up. (He still curses and makes empty threats all the way while leaving though). He is also still not able to just leave us alone, or to start a conversation in a normal way/about a normal topic. We have agreed to stand together, greet when he greets, but not react any further if he behaves inappropriately. We have not involved the police as yet, since his parents promised to get him more help. In six weeks, we have seen very minor improvements. His aggressive behaviour seems a little bit less aggressive. I agreed with my new three friends to go have drinks some where a few weeks after my new job starts, so we can discuss if it is needed to go the police. If necessary, that will sadly have to be our next step.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"775","post_title":"How to deal with a dangerous, developmentally disabled person I can not avoid?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/775","timestamp":"2017-07-23T09:18:34","char_len":"2245","word_len":"414","lang":"en","label":"positive"}

And hope to wind up in the middle of the crossfire.but inevitably as long as you don't join the psychopaths attack on people that don`t join them in their attack they will make life hard for you. be lucky that the group leaders aren't sociopaths/psychopaths. ( which is increasingly rare.) note that having hobbies and being fun and all that help if there are no psychopaths/sociopaths around but that's almost never.

Also insurance will most likely not pay if there is an accident etc. I personally think having a few beers at a party with 16 is not a big problem. On the other hand it is totaly not okay to endanger others while driving drunk. You should make this totally clear.

{"comment_text":"You say that you want to tell her because you think it will help you move on. There are two major errors in this thought: Moving on is a gift you give yourself, it is not something that someone else has to (or, often, even can ) do for you. If you truly want to move on, you need to get out there, meet more people (both men and women), maybe find a new hobby, and build up a good life for yourself without her. Maybe you'll get interested in another woman instead, maybe you won't, but the point is to enjoy your life enough on your own that you no longer feel a need to make her a part of it. Even if you do tell her, it won't help. When I was a teenager, my first love was a girl who was dating one of my friends. She and I were also very close friends, and I told her how I felt about her. She (and everyone else) knew I was totally crazy about her, but we were still able to maintain our friendship. None of this made it any easier for me to deal with or get over my feelings for her - if anything, it made it even more painful to be in that situation, and made it harder for me to move on. Also, in my experience, women tend to be pretty good at picking up on this sort of thing, so there's a good chance she already knows (or at least suspects) how you feel. The kindest thing you can do - for both of you - is to allow her to remain unaware of your feelings (or at least to continue pretending to be unaware) and move on romantically without trying to force the issue with her.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"25631","post_title":"How can I tell a coworker about my feelings for her without damaging our working relationship?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/25631","timestamp":"2020-05-20T01:22:33","char_len":"1508","word_len":"304","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Reiterate that the core issue is related to the autism, and that as a result \"standard\" fixes are not effective. Also consider pointing out that you, too, are trying to minimize your own stress and inconvenience. My experience with autism is also second-hand (relatives and acquaintances with autism, not myself). But I do have OCD and there are a lot of similar situations, as my brain processes information about the environment around me in ways that I know others around me do not. What I have found most useful in those situations is to: Remind the other person (or people) that I have OCD Express that the OCD causes me to perceive and experience things that others do not Acknowledge any inconveniences that arise from tending to my OCD-derived needs Mention (gently) that I also experience a great deal of inconvenience and trouble as a result of dealing with the OCD (it's not just, or even primarily, an issue for the people around me), and to that end I am already trying to achieve the smoothest, easiest result that keeps the OCD manageable Most people do not invest a whole lot of time or effort into examining their preferences or needs in the way that would be necessary to appreciate what something like autism or OCD is like. They legitimately don't understand how something which they can deal with so casually might be more of an issue for a different person. Often the closest they get is imagining a spoiled, neurotypical child who demands that things be their way because that happens to be how they already want it and they stubbornly will refuse anything else. That that analogy isn't a good one is not something a random person is likely to internalize and understand on their own. In a case like that, casual, low-detail reminders that you have autism may backfire. When people don't understand what the experience of having and managing autism is like, or your personal experience of autism, it can seem like the person making that claim is treating it as a magic word to get their way on small, arbitrary issues. A comment like I don't like touching, you know. Autistic -smile-. presumes that the person you're speaking with understands the increased sensitivity to touch common to autism (and/or any other features of the condition that are relevant for you, specifically). If they do not understand this , then this is the opposite of both an explanation and an argument for why your preference should be chosen. You can't make someone else behave respectfully or well, but you can try to correct the mistakes which prevent them from understanding what's going on. When someone says something like: Me: I'm so sorry, your aftershave is causing some sensory issues for me. I've actually got autism and I've got trouble with some strong smells. I would really appreciate if you could tone it down a little in the future. Them: Oh, I get a headache from strong smells too sometimes. A painkiller usually solves it. they are clearly revealing where the breakdown in information and understanding is, and that is knowledge you can use. The other person in this scenario obviously doesn't appreciate how having autism differs from their own experience, evidenced by their commiseration (my reaction to strong smells is a lot like yours) and their \"solution\" which applies to their own situation but not at all to yours. Your response can correct those errors, even though they can't force real understanding in the other person: You: I appreciate the suggestion, but it's not a matter of getting a headache. One of the things that's common with autism is a massively heightened sensitivity to some sensory inputs, like smell. Your aftershave is probably a normal amount with a normal smell (I haven't heard anyone else complain about it), but because of my autism I perceive it a lot more intensely. I experience it more like having Old Spice blasted into each nostril with a firehose, and it can be really difficult for me to focus on anything else while that's going on. I'm sorry, and I'm not blaming you for anything, you didn't do anything wrong or bad, I personally just can't work effectively when I'm around smells that I experience that way. Please believe me, if I could take an Advil and then not have to deal with anything like that, I would. In a heartbeat. But there is no pill for autism-related heightened sensitivity to smells. I made up quite a few details just to fill out an example explanation (like the firehose nostril bit), but the core elements should work regardless of the specific details: no one has done anything wrong, there is simply a situation which no one can change that imposes some extra considerations. If you can describe the consequences of the accommodation not being made for you, that can also help. This won't always produce the results you want-- some people just aren't accommodating, or can't make the accommodations you want, or other possible issues. But if you can, in a calm and straightforward way, clearly express the precise issue you have (not being able to be around strong smells, etc.) and emphasize that the issue is due to an inflexible obstacle (autism), you will give the necessary information to the person that needs it to understand the situation correctly. Other things can help persuade people to try to accommodate you, particularly if you offer suggestions to help meet your needs in a low-impact way or offset the inconvenience to others (a great example of this in the question was offering to drive to the further theater), but I believe that the major problem you're encountering is simply that most people don't know very much about autism and don't understand that accommodations might be needed, or what those accommodations might involve.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":"5816","word_len":"981","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Good question. I think it has its pros and cons. It does put you in contact with a lot of people you wouldn't otherwise be in contact with but in a rather impersonal way. If it wasn't for Facebook, I probably wouldn't often see pictures of my nieces because they live interstate and I don't often get to see my family. Also, if you're part of a social group of some sort people in the group will often use Facebook to communicate with each other. And it can be a good way to find out about community events and organising more personal events (involving friends or family). But yes, it also has its downsides. Now if someone goes on a holiday (vacation) they are often expected to share photos on social media. Meaning that they are often thinking about that instead of just being in the moment. And people often share a lot of crap on Facebook that I never needed to know about it (admittedly I've been guilty of this sometimes too).","platform":"reddit","post_id":"ck232h","post_title":"Has social media done more harm or good to society?","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/ck232h/has_social_media_done_more_harm_or_good_to_society/","timestamp":"1564540024.0","char_len":"936","word_len":"173","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Being around an insufferable know-it-all is one of the most annoying things to ever experience. And, trust me, I used to be one myself... A few years ago, I used to act like I knew everything (something that commonly happens to most teens...) and used to correct every minor mistake in each and every person's business, which usually didn't even concern me. If anyone made any mistake, I would feel like \"Oh my God, that guy's got his basics wrong... I gotta correct him before he goes and ruins his reputation\". I was too concerned with other people and the \"correctness of things\"... With time, my friends began to desert me, and I began to ask myself, what was I doing wrong? By asking a few friends and my parents, I realised that the only mistake I was making was that I was correcting other people's mistakes... I decided to change myself. Now the big question: How? That answer also came to me soon enough. I realised that if constantly correcting other people (due to me caring too much about them and the correctness of things), I was alienating them from me, then perhaps, if I cared a little less, and corrected them only when it was absolutely necessary, maybe, just maybe, they would realise the significance of my telling them? Two years down the line, I became the head boy of my school, because my classmates and my teachers had voted me in. Turns out, caring less actually appears as caring more to most people, and caring too much is generally perceived as a person trying to embarrass others... I'm just sharing an experience here, not really a formal 'answer', so I hope this is useful for you :)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"3654","post_title":"How to stop constantly correcting everyone and everything?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3654","timestamp":"2017-09-10T04:30:41","char_len":"1630","word_len":"290","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Yesterday, he confessed to me he had 3 beers at the party, and he wasn't sleepy but halfway drunk. I didn't push him for that information, he told me out of the blue From this I can tell your brother wanted some kind of feedback from you. Maybe it was his first time drinking beer without parental consent. Maybe he felt guilty or maybe he was seeking approval. Or perhaps it was something he was that proud of that he felt he needed to say. Note however that if he was halfway drunk he might have drank more than 3 beers. How can I express my concerns about my underage brother drinking alcoholic beverages to him without sounding like I'm his mom? Is your goal to express your concerns, or is your goal to safeguard your brother from drinking too much and falling into the canal? They are different goals, and you can change behaviors of others without verbally expressing your concerns.(Sometimes expressing your concern to someone, like you're their mom, can have the opposite effect when they feel their freedom is threatened. This phenomenon is also known as \"reactance\".) Two concepts that are important: Attitude: If your brother has a positive attitude towards alcohol he is more likely to binge drink. Positive attitudes come from positive feelings and thoughts. If your brother associates alcohol consumption with being cool or being an adult or belonging to his peers, then he is more likely to drink. If his peers drink a lot he is more likely to do so. When his parents allowed him to drink at a young age, he is more likely to drink, because of the perceived harm reduction. To change his attitude you should make him aware that it is not cool to drink. You could for example quit drinking yourself which sends a strong message that drinking is not something which makes you a better person. You can verbally express that drinking is not something that makes you a grown-up. You do not have to address your brother directly. Ability: Besides inducing opposing attitudes, your brother should have the ability to change his behavior. If all of his friends drink a beer each hour, he's likely to succumb. You could give your brother hints to drink a soda first before starting to drink beer. This will sent a message to his friends that he chooses to drink what he likes, and they can choose whatever they want to drink themselves. The feeling of empowerment will make him more in control and a create a positive attitude towards controlling his drinking behavior. You can show this behavior yourself to him whenever you go to a terrace or bar. Or tell him directly when you were with your friends that you told them \"I'm not drinking tonight.\" Then your friends started nagging \"Why are you not drinking?\" you stood tall and said \"I don't feel like it\" and just switched the topic. This way you can communicate to your brother skills of how to be in control of his own behavior without directing your brother's behavior directly. Tying positive consequences to performing the behavioral skills increases the motivation and likelihood of performing the skills thereby strengthening them. Also, you should know that this problem might solve itself over time. At age 16 people want to experience stuff. They may have difficulty to control their behavior, and may have difficulty to say no. You can support him by giving him to tools to perform more mature behavior, and expressing the values you hold which your brother of course is allowed to disagree with. Disclaimer: I don't know your brother. These are just general tips.

{"comment_text":"tl;dr: I see two good options: be direct, explaining to your girlfriend your desire to have the experience of living on your own, or be oblique and talk about living alone in a way that allows for a discussion. The direct approach: I love you and want our relationship to keep progressing, but I feel like I need to have experienced living on my own, at least for a while. The direct approach is attractive because it is clear, leaving less room for (mis)interpretation on your girlfriend's part. Even if you are concerned that she will feel hurt, those concerns are non-unique to this approach. Any sort of lie, evasion, or excuse carries the exact same risks, plus the risk of additional hurt as a result of your indirection. If what you are worried about is that she will be upset you are not moving in together, and she in fact would be upset, there will be no way to avoid that if you live by yourself. I say this not to suggest that you are guaranteed to hurt your girlfriend, but that the effects of your decision will exist no matter what approach you take if the overall scenario is one she doesn't like. The indirect approach: I don't recommend this, because there are a thousand ways that your girlfriend could read things into the situation that you did not intend, and you won't necessarily be privy to that information (and therefore won't be able to account for/improve things). But, if you don't want to inform her of why your preference for living alone right now exists, you can casually talk about your new apartment, plans you have for it, etc. It will be important to be ready for a conversation-- if your girlfriend objects to things, or has questions, you will need to address them or else risk appearing dismissive and uninterested in her. That will cause additional strain on your relationship, beyond this issue in itself. You may want to proactively ask about her feelings, to avoid her quietly nurturing some unhappiness, but this will quickly turn into (1) anyways, in which case you may as well be direct from the outset. An additional risk to being indirect is ending up with your girlfriend as an informal roommate. If you maintain separate residences, but she comes over to your new place five nights a week, you may not get the \"living on your own\" experience you're wanting. And if you have a problem with her coming over so often, you'll need to explain why (failing to do so again risks lots of misunderstandings, which won't help your relationship). That, again, brings us back to (1). Background: Your worries are understandable, but are probably less pressing than you imagine. Living independently is a valuable experience, and time to yourself is important. First, the social expectation that you are \"supposed\" to move in with your girlfriend by now is far from absolute. There are a lot of people that would find it scandalous and inappropriate for you two to move in together while unmarried at any point, and a lot of people that would think it's crazy you hadn't moved in together after dating for a much shorter period of time. The only perspectives that really matter are yours and your girlfriend's. You're not required to live together at any point while dating, and my personal experience is that while cohabiting is pretty common among people by the time they reach your age many of those people regret doing so as quickly as they did. That you feel you are \"supposed\" to move in together because of some arbitrary criterion is a terrible reason to move in together. That probably won't remove the sense of pressure you may feel, but to the extent that you are able to not consider that feeling in making your decisions you will likely be better off. There is nothing to feel ashamed about here. Second, while it's important to tend to your girlfriend and your relationship with her (those are separate considerations, by the way), you also need to tend to yourself. Having a need, or even a strong preference, isn't something you need to dismiss only because it's \"just\" for you personally. That's not to say that you should pursue your own self-interest at all times no matter what, but you don't need to feel guilty about wanting something for yourself. The wrinkle here is that you have been \"slower to launch\" than your girlfriend. While living outside of your parents' house will be a new experience for you, your girlfriend has already done so for years. There are a lot of benefits to staying with your parents as you have done (presumably convenience and financial benefits), but it's unreasonable to expect that you can claim those benefits without any tradeoffs at all. If it turns out to be really important to your girlfriend that you move in together soon, you may have \"missed\" your opportunity to live alone while still dating her. Living alone is something that you want, generally; relationship items are things that your girlfriend needs from you, specifically. These aren't symmetrical. If your girlfriend is fine with you living alone for a year or two, after which you start living together, then everything's great. If she's eager for your relationship to advance to living together, she may not be excited to delay things to accommodate the conveniences you've already enjoyed. A major benefit of the direct approach is that you can find out about her feelings immediately, and address them as needed. Your desire seems reasonable to me, but your girlfriend's desires count as well. If you living alone at this point bothers her, but you insist on doing it anyways, then it's a natural consequence that your relationship will suffer a bit. It boils down to whether or not she wants this now, and if so how badly she wants it. Talking to her is the only way you're going to be able to determine and address these things.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"20193","post_title":"How to politely tell my girlfriend that I want to live on my own for some time","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/20193","timestamp":"2018-12-07T12:27:13","char_len":"5836","word_len":"1012","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

I honestly feel that between the two our economy has never really been the same. The events and general mood before the crash needs to be stated first. People were convinced that home prices are going to go up every year, constantly. A home might have been worth $140,000 in 1998 and by 2005/2006 it was worth over $500,000 (which adjusting for inflation would be nearly $800k today. This idea that home values doubled or tripled was something people expected. Spending was high. People were commonly taking loans on homes they already owned to buy fancy cars. Buying a home for $500k when just a few years prior was worth under $200k was not seen as risky. It was seen as buying a $500k home that by the early 2010s will be a million dollar home. Even if you can't afford it, you can still sell it and make hundreds of thousands of dollars. A lot of things during the bubble year didn't feel real. I knew someone who was in his early 20s, he inherited a home with a multi six figure loan on it (more than $400k) and the bank was ok with this transfer of the loan even though he never had a real job to prove his income. I saw people buy homes that were absurdly expensive while they were barely working. We were building a lot of housing in town, but it was nearly all suburban tract home McMansions. Very little of it was urban style living. A little bit by the university, a little bit in downtown. But it was super minimal. People were largely drunk with cheap access to debt. Those big raised trucks with $10,000 lift kits on them were super popular. Big SUVs were popular, it was very common to see vehicles with rear seat TVs, far more common than it is today, I guess this is also because people are on their phones more. The well paying jobs that young men wanted was working in construction, and for women it was being a real estate agent. Everyone wanted to work in real estate. It was a common experience to run into someone you haven't seen in a while and then they tell you they are becoming a real estate agent. It was a grift economy, and people were making a lot of money from grifting or servicing grifters. When the global financial crises happened.. Several sectors of the local economy all went to shit. New home building stopped immediately. All those young men who were employed in the sectors stopped finding work. Immediately. We had an absurdly high unemployment rate among young men. All those real estate agents. Most of them lost their job as well. Many firms and agencies that had to cut back their employees did so with the whole \"Last in, first out\" mentality, so it was very common for a lot of young people who were getting started in their career to be shown the door. New car sales took a hit. A lot of people could not pay the note on their big trucks and other stupid flashy cars, those disappeared. Local wages plummeted. Jobs that were paying $15 per hour in the late 90s and early 2000s were paying $8 per hour in 2010. We went from like 5-6% umemployment in 2006 to 14% unemployment by 2009. The unemployment rate stuck around for years. People were commonly losing their homes. I remember taking bike rides in the neighborhood and seeing homes with everything inside the home brought out and sitting on the front lawn. The people who weathered the storm the best were people who owned a home free and clear, no mortgage. Nothing flashy. Just good ole rock stability. Job loss.. they can get through it. As i mentioned, home construction stopped. Many of these homes were places that were not finished. It was common to hear about people breaking into the homes and stealing all the copper wire. This whole \"If you work a trade you will never be unemployed\". It was total bullshit. These were among the people who got hit the hardest. Unemployed plumber was common. I knew a surveyor who I grew up with and he lived around the corner, he told me that in 2006, as a 22 year old kid, he was making $120,000. Before the crash in 2007 he made $80,000 and thought he was going to surpass 2006. By 2008 he said he would go weeks without being called, and barely made $20,000. I don't think his business rebounded until the mid 2010s. What I did see was people with money buying homes with the intention of fixing them up and flipping them. They had the mentality that this drop in prices was brief, very brief. A lot of them though prices would completely recover by 2010 or 2011. So the mentality was, buy homes, and then completely fix them up. Maybe pay $200k for the home, $50,000 for fixing it up, and in a few years when the economy is back, sell it for $700,000. Profit $450,000. I knew several people who were doing this. The thing is, the housing economy didn't come back in 2011. Or 2012. Or 2013. Even by 2019, 10 years after they bought it, the home was not worth $700k. But what did they do in the mean time. They rented the homes out. Do understand. While some effects were immediate in 2007 and 2008. Many long term effects still persisted well into the early 2010s. I would say 2011 and 2012 were still rough recession years and by that point it had been going on for five years.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/1dny150/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after/","timestamp":"1719291758.0","char_len":"5401","word_len":"980","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I'm using a custom keyboard to input an Hex number so I can't have the IMM keyboard show up... In v3.2.4_r1 setSoftInputShownOnFocus(boolean show) was added to control weather or not to display the keyboard when a TextView gets focus, but its still hidden so reflection must be used: if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR2) { try { Method method = TextView.class.getMethod(\"setSoftInputShownOnFocus\", boolean.class); method.invoke(mEditText, false); } catch (Exception e) { // Fallback to the second method } } For older versions, I got very good results (but far from perfect) with a OnGlobalLayoutListener , added with the aid of a ViewTreeObserver from my root view and then checking if the keyboard is shown like this: @Override public void onGlobalLayout() { Configuration config = getResources().getConfiguration(); // Dont allow the default keyboard to show up if (config.keyboardHidden != Configuration.KEYBOARDHIDDEN_YES) { InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE); imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(mRootView.getWindowToken(), 0); } } This last solution may show the keyboard for a split second and messes with the selection handles.

{"comment_text":"I agree with the suggested actions in this answer by Valorum -- report it to the train station every time it happens, keep a log, and confer with the other affected women. But I noticed something additional in your question that hasn't been addressed: A developmentally disabled person has to take the same train to get to this special workplace for developmentally disabled people . So you have somebody who's dangerously aggressive and invasive, who according to the police can't be held responsible for his actions, but he's in some sort of special program . My next step in your situation would be to contact the people in charge of that special workplace. If they are responsible for training him in life skills, they need to know about this profound failure so they can address it. If they are not responsible for that -- if they're just a workplace that has agreed to employ developmentally-disabled people -- then they, in turn, must be working with somebody else who's making the connections -- a government agency, a clinic or hospital, an advocacy group, or something similar, and they ought to be able to help you escalate your complaint. (I haven't been in your situation; my threatening encounters with mentally-unstable individuals have been one-time encounters, not every day, and the methods of dealing with them are different. I'm drawing this answer from experience escalating complaints within the workplace and other organizations; those situations weren't threatening in the way that yours is, but \"involve the person who is somehow superior to the problem person\" is the approach that has worked for me.) In a later comment you added: I have just started trying some of the approaches here this week. So far, trying to steer the conversation away to other smalltalk (as suggested by Yosef Baskin) has failed. Apparently his obsession (see the comment on that answer) is getting to know as much personal details from a female as possible (where do you live? is his favourite question). I made sure to tell the male commuter I know from church what I was going to try, and he has 'rescued' me twice this week. I'll try it for the rest of this week, if nothing changes I will ask the other females to take some organized action. You are describing warning signs of stalking, particularly the attempts to get personal information about you. The common advice when dealing with repeated harassment of the creepy variety (examples: 1 2 3 4 ) is: don't engage, do seek help . You've already tried telling him to leave you alone; it didn't work. Under no conditions should you give him any information that he could use to cause even more trouble for you. Ignoring him isn't working for you either, and is unlikely to. Report this to the train station and his workplace, as already mentioned. Further, you and the other women should strongly consider contacting the police. Even if they say they can't do anything, having the reports on file -- starting to build a paper trail -- could help later. Who knows; they might have said \"we can't do anything\" when they thought it was one harmless pest bothering one person, but if they see that it's multi-target, sustained harassment, perhaps they'll try harder to help you.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"775","post_title":"How to deal with a dangerous, developmentally disabled person I can not avoid?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/775","timestamp":"2017-07-23T09:18:34","char_len":"3289","word_len":"553","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I would try to firmly establish boundaries that you both can live with. This would involve compromising on both your side and hers. Judging from your comment, you can go without smoking for quite some time and even do so for weekends and vacations. That might be a good place to start! You'll have to open with the decision to keep smoking. Maybe even an apology for hiding the habit (although you don't have to go into the full detail). But if you then transition into a cooperative discussion over how you can set boundaries, you can show that you are in fact compromising. After opening on your decision to not stop, bring up how you would like to establish when and how you can smoke without interfering with her. Yes, you didn't give in to the ask to stop, but by asking for input and offering ideas, you are demonstrating the ability to compromise and a wish to work with her rather than against her. I'll admit I am a complete non-smoker and have quite a few problems with it since even second-hand smoke is quite harsh for me. I've had breathing problems. Anyways, I had a roommate for 4 years that was an avid smoker (pack a day at one point) and we were able to make it work. This was done through boundaries. My roommate would only smoke outside for instance. Now you don't have to hold to that strict a standard, but I would recommend you pick a particular place or two around your home that you smoke and no more. You said its part of your routine, but I'm not sure where/when this applies. If you only smoke at work, this is a lot easier, but I'm guessing you're trying to smoke at home to. Non-smokers (depending on sensitvitiy) can smell smoke for quite some time, and it usually embeds itself in furniture over time. If you pick a 'designated' area then yes, the problem is still there, but it can be either in a location she doesn't use often (a personal den of yours) or in an area that has good airflow and she doesn't have to remain in 'contact' with the air for long. Best way to sound uncompromising? Actually compromise and work out the best solution both can live with. That does mean neither side gets everything they want (She didn't get you to stop smoking and you'll have to match your routine to these boundaries) but it sounds like you both care about each other. Thats more important and I wish you luck in working this out.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"21421","post_title":"Communicating to my partner that I don&#39;t want to stop smoking","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/21421","timestamp":"2019-03-29T18:25:04","char_len":"2390","word_len":"436","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"We had recently bought a house with a higher monthly payment (a fixer-upper at that). We both worked at the same company that hit a major sales decline, which the company responded to by cutting salaries for salaried employees and hours for production workers. We very much supported the pay cuts, because that was chosen as an alternative to laying people off. We all made less money but nobody lost their job. The salary cuts were progressive, meaning the higher-paid employees suffered deeper cuts. My wife and I just barely made enough to be in the middle tier, which was a 13% cut. Which meant we had to tighten our belts financially, and we were no longer able to put any money into fixing up the house. We were 13% down for two years, then the pay came back in increments, so it was five years before we made the same money again - five years right in the middle of the time period where people our age generally make the most gains as they progress professionally. So that wasn't just five years of lost wages, that was five years of missing out on significant raises. We didn't complain because a lot of people had it much worse. And although the pay cut hurt, we felt proud to work for a company that worked so hard to avoid cutting people loose. At the time, the biggest pain in the ass was living in an unfinished house for years. In retrospect, though, the biggest impact was that we postponed starting a family for quite a few years. By the time we had things sorted out enough that we felt comfortable having a kid, we were pretty old for it. Again, we were SUPER LUCKY because a hell of a lot of people who try to start a family at that age have to deal with fertility challenges, and the painful and expensive treatments to address them. And feelings of inadequacy and regret. Whereas when we finally started trying, my wife immediately got pregnant. I mean *immediately*. So we were spared that. However, by the time we would have been thinking about having a second child, we were old enough that it didn't seem like a good idea. We're already well older than the parents of any of our son's peers. We'd be older still for the hypothetical second kid. And my wife was now in the age range where the chances of genetic defects starts rising [exponentially with each passing year](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Risk-of-Down-Syndrome-and-all-chromosomal-abnormalities-by-maternal-age_fig1_351225040). So we just have our son. Which is fine, but we love him so much, and he's so great, it's hard not to feel sad sometimes that we couldn't squeeze out just one more kid.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/1dny150/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after/","timestamp":"1719291758.0","char_len":"2614","word_len":"455","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"The reason why performance improves drastically when the data is sorted is that the branch prediction penalty is removed, as explained beautifully in Mysticial's answer . Now, if we look at the code if (data[c] >= 128) sum += data[c]; we can find that the meaning of this particular if... else... branch is to add something when a condition is satisfied. This type of branch can be easily transformed into a conditional move statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: cmovl , in an x86 system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed. In C , thus C++ , the statement, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in x86 , is the ternary operator ... ? ... : ... . So we rewrite the above statement into an equivalent one: sum += data[c] >=128 ? data[c] : 0; While maintaining readability, we can check the speedup factor. On an Intel Core i7 -2600K @ 3.4 GHz and Visual Studio 2010 Release Mode, the benchmark is: x86 Scenario Time (seconds) Branching - Random data 8.885 Branching - Sorted data 1.528 Branchless - Random data 3.716 Branchless - Sorted data 3.71 x64 Scenario Time (seconds) Branching - Random data 11.302 Branching - Sorted data 1.830 Branchless - Random data 2.736 Branchless - Sorted data 2.737 The result is robust in multiple tests. We get a great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern. Now let's look more closely by investigating the x86 assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions max1 and max2 . max1 uses the conditional branch if... else ... : int max1(int a, int b) { if (a > b) return a; else return b; } max2 uses the ternary operator ... ? ... : ... : int max2(int a, int b) { return a > b ? a : b; } On an x86-64 machine, GCC -S generates the assembly below. :max1 movl %edi, -4(%rbp) movl %esi, -8(%rbp) movl -4(%rbp), %eax cmpl -8(%rbp), %eax jle .L2 movl -4(%rbp), %eax movl %eax, -12(%rbp) jmp .L4 .L2: movl -8(%rbp), %eax movl %eax, -12(%rbp) .L4: movl -12(%rbp), %eax leave ret :max2 movl %edi, -4(%rbp) movl %esi, -8(%rbp) movl -4(%rbp), %eax cmpl %eax, -8(%rbp) cmovge -8(%rbp), %eax leave ret max2 uses much less code due to the usage of instruction cmovge . But the real gain is that max2 does not involve branch jumps, jmp , which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right. So why does a conditional move perform better? In a typical x86 processor, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called pipelining . In a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we cannot do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict. In a conditional move case, the execution of conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like Fetch and Decode do not depend on the result of the previous instruction; only the latter stages need the result. Thus, we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when the prediction is easy. The book Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition explains this in detail. You can check Section 3.6.6 for Conditional Move Instructions , entire Chapter 4 for Processor Architecture , and Section 5.11.2 for special treatment for Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties . Sometimes, some modern compilers can optimize our code to assembly with better performance, and sometimes some compilers can't (the code in question is using Visual Studio's native compiler). Knowing the performance difference between a branch and a conditional move when unpredictable can help us write code with better performance when the scenario gets so complex that the compiler can not optimize them automatically.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":"4489","word_len":"703","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I'll give a few practical solutions. Some of these are harder to execute than others, but they assume a relatively low level of existing social skills. The hardest one involves starting to build models of other people's cognition. This is quite difficult, and (in my experience) requires working with only a few people at a time. Start with a stimulus-response \"black box\", and treat your assumptions about why people do things - even the meaning of words! - with very low confidence levels. You need to keep around multiple possible interpretations and goals and meanings for their actions at once, and even open yourself up to the possibility that the person you are talking with doesn't have a single goal, interpretation or meaning for what they are saying, but rather forms back-justifications for their actions after the fact based on further events. Ie, someone could smile at you, and the smile could have different meanings to them based on what happens after the smile occurs. When they smiled, they might not know why they smiled, and their interpretation of the smile can depend on your reaction and the rest of the scenario the smile occurs in. Doing this in real time is extremely hard. But you can look back at past interactions and try to reframe it in this way. Avoid trying to be overly negative (or positive) in your evaluations of meaning and motivation behind actions - instead, but vague and multi-stated . They laughed possibly for a half-dozen reasons at once, not just one reason. They interrupted for a half-dozen reasons. Etc. What more, because the meaning of their actions aren't determined before the action occurs, sometimes you can successfully change the meaning of their actions after they do their action by making the alternative meaning more consistent with their future back-narrative. A crude example of this can be seen with some toddler experiments. You bring out a tin of cookies and ask them what was in the tin. They'll say cookies. You open up the tin and show crayons. If the child is young enough, and you ask them \"when I came in the room, what did you think was in the tin\" they'll say \"crayons\". Why did you say cookies? \"I was trying to trick you\". Their own perceived motivation behind saying \"cookies\" retroactively was rewritten, and they'll steadfastly remember they tried to trick you, because they have no memory of any chain of reasoning behind their original \"cookies\" claim. Instead, they build a justification based on their current state. Lot of people engage in social interaction without doing chains of reasoning to decide on what action they will do at each time. Instead, they are operating on autopilot. The lack of conscious decision making behind their operations means that the reason for their actions is subject to retroactive rewriting - and this is even honest, because the quote real quote reason wasn't even a conscious operation! Practicing this can help prevent reducing other people's motivations too much. Maybe they are interrupting because they don't respect you, but the cause is also going to be a rainbow of other antecedents; and what more, you could possibly retroactively change the cause of the interruption to something else (in their mind) if you make another interpretation more consistent with their future state of mind. Building a decent mental model of another individual like this is a lot of work. Getting the framework to do it in general could take years, and doing it for an individual (especially the first few times) could take months of interaction with them. And then running this model even when you have it ends up being mentally exhausting! But, as an example, doing this to determine \"which gift should I buy person X\" can result in someone being very pleasantly surprised. So that is the hard route. Easier routes can involve learning macros and tricks that reduce the chance of the bad social reaction result. The idea of building up macros - tiny social scripts - is to reduce the amount you have to think during social small talk. Your conscious mind isn't as \"smart\" as your entire brain and definitely isn't as fast; so as we practice certain operations we \"automate\" them out of consciousness. Lookup tables for mathematical operations, driving, walking - these are things we farm out to our non-conscious mind to handle, while our consciousness handles problems that are novel. You'll want a set of low-mental-effort conversational macros you can use to buy time, and ways to prepare and embellish the next macros you are going to use in the conversation. Some low-effort macros include \"turn the question around\", \"make it a joke or pun\", \"talk about it dismissively\", \"acknowledge and change the subject\", \"use a canned response\". Person: \"What do you do again?\" Me: \"I'm a software developer.\" So here, you can give yourself more time to prepare for the conversation by adding \"... and you?\" You don't have to care about what they do. But by throwing the question back at them, you can get them to put more effort into the conversation and buy time for future questions about your job. In addition, their response can provide further \"hooks\" to buy time in the future; whatever they mention, you can tangent back to later on. (Suppose they are a massage therapist; while the conversation proceeds, you can see if your memory pops up any facts or personal things related to that.) Person: \"I bet you don't like that.\" Me: \"I like it.\" This is an example of a conversational dead end. When you respond to someone with something on which the conversation has few remaining threads. The other person in the conversation is likely to flail about looking for a way to prevent the sudden conversational stop: the two options are \"ask you to list and discuss\" and \"ask you to list and dispute what you say\". Imagine you had asked about their job and they provided it. Then this could have been \"I do; how about you?\" - you are under 5 words, and instead of dropping a conversational dead end, you have thrown the ball back into their court. They get to talk about themselves (which most people will do endlessly if prompted) and you get to buy more time. There is a subject on the table that isn't \"are your statements valid\", because now both of you have statements in play. You'll now have a much richer set of things you can \"legitimately\" bring up. You can bring up features about their job, you can bring up things about what they like about their job, you can compare and contrast what you like about your job to what they like about your job, you can even talk about how parts of what they like about their job wouldn't be for you. What more, this entire menu of options can be slid in later in the conversation whenever you don't like the way the conversation is going. Person: \"Oh, really? What do you like about it?\" Me: \"Mostly, I like that--\" [this is where I'd rather pass and not answer] Person: \"I bet it's just about the money.\" Me: \"Nope.\" I mean, \"puzzles\" is a great one-word answer here. \"The quiet\". You are probably going to be asked about your job a large number of times, and the set of questions people probe you on in casual conversation tends to be quite limited. Having a set of stock answers - short and flippant - that can segway into more conversation can save you lots of effort. \"Puzzles, like a jigsaw\" answers quickly and adds another possible subject. \"The quiet; it is too loud in here\" another. Joking answers are also great, because they avoid vulnerable information disclosure, and if an obvious joke they elicit a response and require more thinking on the part of the conversational partner (again, buying time). Playing a conversation as a game of tennis helps a lot here. Each response should attempt to request a response from the other party; even if you don't care, this can buy you time to prepare for your next response, and it turns the conversation from being centered only on you and what you have said (which you don't want, as it could involve challenging your statements validity) to being about things you both say. If the history of the conversation is list of facts you have said, the next topic is either a relationship between those facts, another semi-connected fact, or disagreeing with one of those facts. If the history of the conversation is facts from both parties, then relationships between those facts becomes legitimate next topics to discuss. \"We both like X\", or \"I like X you like Y\" are less disrespectful than \"you are wrong about X\". Instead of catching the conversational lob, send it back with a new spin. Person: \"What do you do again?\" Me: \"Code monkey. You?\" Less serious. Cheap lob back. Person: \"I process health insurance claims. I bet you don't like that?\" Me: \"I enjoy the quiet. You don't?\" Here, their job is also quiet, or at least you can assume it, and you can contrast their experience. You don't answer yes/no, you skip that step, and instead go to a part you like. Person: \"I bet it's just about the money.\" They interrupt anyhow. Me: \"Ha! What do you like about your job?\" I didn't disagree, I laughed. It is hard to disagree with a laugh, and I don't really want to talk about if my main motivation was money. So I laughed, dismissed it, and tossed a ball back at them. In further parts of this conversation, I can go back to past questions and bring up \"Also, puzzles\" or \"I can work from home\" or whatever as a somewhat valid topic. I can even talk about how the money isn't the motivation if I want, but talking about money is a social mine-field, so I'd probably avoid it. For common topics, having cheap macros ready (I like puzzles, quiet, work from home) ready to spit out is useful. Slightly more expensive macros (How about you? Dismissing a common response. Connecting something you commonly say to something they say \"X is sort of like a puzzle\".) require limited mental load and can be prepared in the background as they respond to your conversational lobs. Now this isn't free - we are talking about listening to their questions and answers while preparing responses and keeping your body language engaged all at the same time. So it requires practice. The lost-mental-cost macros with practice should make the preparing responses cheap enough that you can do it in parallel with them taking their turn. The final thing you can work on is stuff like speaking rhythm, tone, body language, etc. People are probably picking up something from how you speak that makes them think that after 5 words it is their turn to speak. Possibly delay between words is high or irregular, or even an initial delay before responding, or some other detail is inadvertently sending a signal or \"now it is your turn\". If they think they are getting such a signal and you push through, they will get confused, and may not even know why they thought it was their turn. But to them, it feels like you are interrupting them instead of the other way around. Determining what you yourself sound like to others is hard without recording your own conversations or getting a professional to help out. But you could try some hypothesis and see if variations cause better or worse results.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28921","post_title":"How to pass on a question when you cannot answer efficiently","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28921","timestamp":"2025-01-01T22:19:33","char_len":"11355","word_len":"1949","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"When living in the US, I noticed that there were no differences between cultures when it comes to the loss of someone: people are affected by the loss, and it takes time to heal. During the mourning process, people can be sad, tired, depressed and so on... Expressing can be very different though. Many european countries I know have the same \"etiquette\", and it seemed to me that they are very similar to the ones in the US. In the case of death, when consolation is not possible, just to let the bereaved know that you care is doing your best. Offer your own words in the most considerate, genuine, kind, and courteous manner. 1 Also said, keep in mind the \" 3 C rule \" : Compassion, Courtesy, Common sense. Show that you care with an expression of sorrow, and keep it as simple as possible. Beware of: unsolicited advice. words meant to â€œcheer upâ€ or encourage. words of clichÃ©d wisdom or of your own experience. 2 I've been taught that you should say or write very very little, and be very careful not to do too much. The worst I've ever heard was : \" I know how you feel... \". No, you don't! No one knows, we're all different. We have suffered the same thing, it doesn't mean we feel or react the same way. In your case, nothing personal, keep it \" professional \", so very very simple, on a card or note: I'm so sorry to learn about [family member]. If there's anything I can do, please let me know. I'm not writing emails because I think there's nothing appropriate you can write in the \"object\" case. I send a simple card. You can send this to his office. Even if this is affecting your work, and you struggle, look for alternatives measures, channels or strategies, avoid bothering the person who just lost someone (or is dealing with serious illness). Even when attending a funeral, I would not go beyond this. It can be said or written, I've always done that for the ones that I knew (or not), family, coworkers, relatives or acquaintances. Always keep it short and simple, don't add anything to their pain . 1 2 Candace Smith Etiquette -- Emily Post Etiquette -- Indeed / message of condolence (because it's almost a professional background in your case, so examples can be useful)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26956","post_title":"What is the proper etiquette for when someone you&#39;re not very close with is dealing with a terminally ill family member?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/26956","timestamp":"2021-04-16T14:33:23","char_len":"2245","word_len":"401","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"As an only vegan in a company and often in a group I learned that there is no right answer and there is no reason to be dishonest. If someone resents you for your answer or choice of lifestyle, you are just not meant to agree or please everyone in every situation.

My advice would be to answer their question without judgement as well as you can and just accept that some people may have different views. I learned to avoid conflict by not getting too vocal about it or defending my view in this topic because it never gets resolved. Some people are generally just curious and want to learn what lead you to your decision to be vegan. If you are looking to meet like minded people who you can relate with, I ended up starting a local vegan meetup group and made a lot of great vegan friends and we often discuss this topic among us.

{"comment_text":"You've made it pretty clear that you want to avoid alienating your brother from telling you these things in the future. To do so, focus on delivering a clear and concise message by getting your point across in a few sentences. You do not want to prepare a speech, because repeating information your brother already knows is likely to make you sound like a pseudo-parent. You could casually mention some 'tips' for taking care of himself and gauging what he already knows by saying something like: Dude (however you address him), if you ever drink more than that, you want to make sure you drink water before you fall asleep or you'll feel like crap in the morning. or If you drink more than that, do you make sure to drink water before you go to bed so you don't feel like crap the next day? If you throw out casual tips, this earns his trust because you're sharing experienced advice with him ( even if you don't drink much/often, it shows that you must still be knowledgeable enough to approach about it ). Best of all, it opens the door for him to come to you if he ever finds himself in need of advice or help. However, it's still probably important to tell him directly something along the lines of: Hey/Also, now that I know you sometimes drink at parties, I just want to say that I'll always come get you if you need a ride. I'm never going to rat you out to Mom/Dad, but I do want to make sure you get home safe if you ever drink more than just a of couple beers. I'm from the United States, but I've found that many of my friends parents who told them to \"just call\" regardless of if they felt they'd get in trouble, were much more likely to utilize them as a resource than those who didn't have that type of support.

{"comment_text":"I've never been good at accepting compliments/flattery either. I often thought them confusing, not really understanding why people would get it in their head to compliment me. After all, there were a lot more people in the world that were better looking/ more skilled. (even trying to tell him politely that I daily see myself in mirror and there is nothing which you saw) comments like, \"you look handsome\", \"looking a hero today\", \"you get a lot of looks\", etc. keep on coming. I don't have supermodel looks either. So these comments used to confuse me a lot. Until I figured out that if somebody tells me I look nice today, they are probably complimenting the effort I put into my clothing, hair or makeup that day. They might even be seeing that I spent a few minutes in the sun and have a nice color on my face (not as pale as usually). I know myself and I find very embarrassed by this advanced way of pinching. I'll start with point 2, since this is the easiest: It's okay to feel uncomfortable when getting a compliment. Blush, smile, say thank you and move on. People most likely will find your reaction 'cute' (at least, that what I'm often told). There is nothing wrong with showing that you are a humble person. That said, it might be exactly this reaction that has your co-workers complimenting you. Only then, they are doing it to tease you. Teasing a person sometimes is okay, teasing you so much it borders on bullying is not. Have you tried a firm \"Stop teasing me?\". If I said, I don't like it, then it must be respected. Okay, so have clearly stated \"Stop teasing, I don't like it\" . Mentioning the word 'teasing' is important in my opinion since it conveys clearly how you think about your co-workers and their endless stream of compliments. Or you could mention that their behavior feels more like they are bullying you since the high frequency and ridiculousness of some of their compliments make you think that they aren't serious at all. You could even threaten to take this to a higher authority (manager/boss) if they keep it up: you asked them to stop, they didn't so now it has grown into bullying. But you can't really get people to stop offering you compliments. I think this might reduce the frequency of how often you get them: You also said this yesterday/ You have already stated this thrice this week. Please, if you want to compliment me, do it sparsely. I can't really take you seriously if you make the same compliment so often. This might work especially well if those people are just trying to make compliments/flatter you because they want something from you/ want you to hold them in high esteem. They want you to think well of them, so they are most likely to adhere to your wishes. That being said, unless you are very sure that they compliments are made because they know that it causes you discomfort , there is really not much you can do other than saying a quick 'Thank you' and move on.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"4443","post_title":"How to politely repel a flattering comment","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/4443","timestamp":"2017-09-22T10:36:39","char_len":"2989","word_len":"531","lang":"en","label":"positive"}

{"comment_text":"As a lifelong vegetarian I find giving a humorous answer, rather than a serious one is the first line of defense. My favorite is \"I'm not a vegetarian because I like animals, it's because I hate vegetables.\" This usually gets a chuckle, and conversation can move on to other things, as most of the time people are asking to be polite. The beauty of this is that if they really are interested, they have the opportunity to ask the \"real\" reason I'm a vegetarian at a later point, but if they're not (which is the case most of the time) I've effectively answered their question without answering it. If they do inquire further, how you frame your response can affect how it's received.

Human action can also change the temperature of the earth. >If we were around back then would people be trying to fill the atmosphere with as much carbon dioxide as possible? Possibly, if we really couldnâ€™t come up with any other way to maintain a livable temperature. But thatâ€™s like saying quantum mechanics canâ€™t exist because â€œwell is it really possible that the universe runs on probabilities?â€ >I'm nearly 44 years old and I've yet to notice a significant change in the weather or temperature What youâ€™ve personally noticed and what can be scientifically shown arenâ€™t the same thing. Iâ€™ve never personally noticed a quantum of light or the bending of a photon as it passed a gravity well. >I live in Virginia, and yes people keep bringing up Hurricane Florence, but I've been here a long time and heavy rains and hurricanes are nothing new The average size of hurricanes is growing. Hurricanes arenâ€™t new, neither are floods.

{"comment_text":"Honestly the greenwashing that non carbon emitting generators get away with is indicative of the black and white thinking which dominates our public policy discussion and leads to poor outcomes. Energyâ€™s impact on the environment (as hidden through this map) is an n-dimensional hyperspace with differential effects based on location. - All non-local generation and storage requires land and distribution infrastructure that could otherwise be dedicated to something of more environmental or social value - Hydro floods valleys and destroys ecosystems (and in some cases homes). - Any generator that produces any sort of waste requires some sort of waste processing and management facility All in all the climate crisis is in front of mind right now. CO2 emissions are out of control and these generators arenâ€™t sustainable for however many billions of us there are. But the owners of distribution and generation assets have us exactly where they want us. Rather than people adding generation, storage, and passive electricity saving measures to their homes where the marginal cost to the environment is low we are talking about building nuclear plants again, flooding valleys, taking up huge amounts of land for vast solar farms, building giant wind farms through migration patterns. No solution is perfect and we need to aim for what works and what works quick but decarbonising our economy is going to be fatiguing and if we donâ€™t add up the opportunity-costs of the solutions quickly we are going to end up with a big tab to pay for the environment at the end.

{"comment_text":"You're right and you're wrong about your assumptions. You certainly cannot force him to not text and drive, as he is an adult. However, he is endangering your safety and if that bothers you then you should speak up . Your other friends seem okay with that. And that's fine for them, but don't count on their support. In fact, when you speak to your texting friend, make sure your friends aren't there to back him up. First and foremost: 1. Refuse to be in a car with him unless he doesn't text and drive We all have our risk tolerances, but we must respect our differences in that regard. Your friend has no right to make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Be firm, but not rude. This is all you have to say: Either I drive, or you stay off your phone while driving, or I don't wish to come with you guys. Sorry. If your friend chooses his phone over your friendship, that's quite a problem. Your safety is more important than any interpersonal skills. Note: If this issue is a little less serious, and you don't mind dragging it out longer to possibly reach a more amicable solution, you can try to convince your friend to stop his habit, at least around you, which leads me to... 2. Talk to your friend, privately You've already tried saying something while he does it. He knows you don't like it and he's made his decision. Your only choice to convince him is a private conversation. This conversation is going to be highly contextual, so I cannot give you many things to say. However, you must make it about your safety/comfort, not about his ability . He may be the best driver in the world, perhaps with an incredible multi-tasking ability. Perhaps he has 2 brains and 4 working arms. Well, chances are he's like the rest of us, and is statistically unable to text and drive without risking at least a moderate amount of safety. Regardless, you need to make him understand that the consequence of his action is that your experience is damaged. And you need him to tell you whether or not he cares about that. If he doesn't... see option 1. PS: Leave out any details about his phone usage outside of driving. That issue is a separate (but probably related) issue. However, you need to tackle one at a time.

{"comment_text":"Why do you need to come across as uncompromising? This is a decision in which there is no compromise since it has a binary outcome... you either quit smoking or you don't... there is no compromise to be had. The compromise can be found in the logistics of you smoking like: You can't smoke in the house Don't smoke when you are around me Don't smoke in my car Etc. With that being said, I have had similar issues (not about smoking) where my wife has tried to push me to do something. Her motivation may have come from the heart and she had my best interests in mind but I simply told her that although I appreciated her concern that I am a grown man and will make my own decision on the matter. Sure, we've argued and she has played the \"you're not flexible\" card but I tell her something to this effect... ... when you have two people playing tug-of-war against each other and thus pulling equally hard in opposite directions, then both people are inflexible and uncompromising otherwise one would drop the rope.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"21421","post_title":"Communicating to my partner that I don&#39;t want to stop smoking","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/21421","timestamp":"2019-03-29T18:25:04","char_len":"1030","word_len":"187","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Netiquette Netiquette is highly specific for different websites. Just as etiquette differs from county to country, so does netiquette from website to website. Facebook has a very wide userbase (also from different countries), so the netiquette is very likely to be different from group to group as well. As such, it is hard to say whether this went against 'the netiquette', nor is it possible to say whether it is against the netiquette of that specific group. However, if the reaction of the moderator is a fair reflection of the netiquette in that group, then it could very well have been. Your feedback In general, however, this doesn't seem to be out of line. It doesn't sound like you were simply bashing the OP, or even trying to be hurtful. Furthermore, they specifically asked for feedback , pointing to a few areas where they might be able to improve. As your private messages show, no offense was taken. If feedback is only allowed to be nice and sugarcoated, the feedback is pointless. If that is the only acceptable response, the OP isn't looking for feedback, they simply want to show off their work and be able to ignore all wrongs with it. How to handle the PM from the moderator You could explain your point that they specifically asked for feedback and that in a PM you had an amicable exchange, so no offense was given: I'm sorry that you feel this feedback was offensive. The asker specifically asked for feedback, and they even responded thankfully. That's pretty much all you can do. Explain yourself and that is that. It serves little purpose to sugarcoat things, making your point more unclear. On the other hand, this shouldn't really be a reason for the moderator to start banning you. Don't expect their opinion to change though, not for this post, or for future posts. That way, you can't be disappointed. It's also not worth getting into an argument over this with the moderator, you are unlikely to convince them of your right, while you are likely to rub hairs the wrong way and possibly get yourself kicked. If your intention of joining the group is to have a place to improve your crafts and give honest feedback, this might just not be the group for you. There are plenty of these groups out there, so there really is no reason to stick around in a place you don't like. The diversity of groups on Facebook also brings with it a diversity of etiquette. Find yourself one that matches your intentions. On why it is not worth arguing While this is something you might be emotionally invested in, all it takes for the moderator to deal with your arguments is a single press on the delete/ban button. I have seen this happen from both sides, not only on Facebook, but also in game chats and on other websites; people disagreeing with how a group is moderated and going on a crusade to convince everybody of their right. And it doesn't matter if you are right or not, 9 out of 10 times, the moderator grows tired of you and throws you out. Being emotionally invested doesn't help you beating a brick wall, it only hurts more. And that is even assuming that the problem lies just with the moderator. If the entire moderation team, or even the entire community feels the same way, you are going to have an even hard time convincing them.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"6817","post_title":"Does it go against netiquette to give constructive feedback on Facebook?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/6817","timestamp":"2017-11-16T07:57:52","char_len":"3306","word_len":"582","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Your friend is probably not really lying, at least not primarily to you. This sounds like a case of her not being truthful to herself first and foremost. I would assume that she would honestly like the things she says to you to be true (that she's not into relationships right now, that the thing with her ex is over, etc.), but evidently they are not. In other words, she probably believes what she tells you when she tells it to you - but then things change when he texts or calls. If you want to be her friend, the best thing you can do is probably to have an honest conversation about what is going on in her love life. Happy people typically don't flip-flop between \"I am so over this\" and \"he is coming to my place in an hour so you need to get out\". What you can do as a friend is help her come to understand her own emotions - maybe, even likely, she isn't quite over this guy, and that's fine, but she should understand how she feels so that she can make informed decisions. As Legisey says, it's important to not judge her for her emotions (it's ok to still have feelings for somebody, even if these feelings led her to heartbreak before), but that does not necessarily mean that the best course of action is to jump right back into a relationship. Alternating between \"I hate that guy\" and one-night stands is probably even worse. These are things that you as a friend can help her talk through (but keep in mind that at the end of the day it's not about you - if she tells you she will not see him again only to hook up with him the next day, she isn't doing this to spite you!). Of course, there is also the alternate possibility that, at least from her side, your relationship isn't quite platonic, and that's why she wants to convince you that she is in fact single and (almost) available. We random people on the Internet can't figure this out for you, but it's certainly a possibility to consider if she does not want to talk about her ex to specifically you.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"18731","post_title":"Politely ask a female friend to stop lying to me about her relationship","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/18731","timestamp":"2018-09-24T04:46:15","char_len":"1986","word_len":"376","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

Also people are not ideal autonomous agents. Instead they are influenced by people around them and media they consume. You might not have become a vegan if you hadn't watched those documentaries. Maybe you have done something else, not related to meat or animals, that could be considered morally wrong. Maybe you contributed to climate change by using a plane. Or you have let people down when they relied on you. Maybe the person you are talking to is not a vegan, but has other areas where they make an effort, like being really good parents, responsible car drivers, helping out in the neighborhood etc. In this spirit, you can say something like this: I watched too many icky documentaries about meat production, this destroyed my appetite for animal products. or From what I learned over time about how animals are kept and treated these days, I decided I don't want to do it anymore. I wanted to prove to myself that I can live without animal products. Now I don't even remember how it tastes like.

{"comment_text":"I've been in a situation where I was a good student going a bit bad and threatening to drop studies because of depression. I have a mental illness which usually strikes in teenage and spike in early twenties. While I am unsure if our two cases relate since little is known about your friend real problem, I believe I can advise on a few pointers on how to help. I would first advise to take the case seriously. Depressed people are hard to care about and capable of the worst. Sometimes the cause is a difficult breakup, difficult situation in the family, sometimes the cause is inner like mine. Provided you can't send him straight to a professional, the important thing is to be there where he needs like you did on the phone. Isolation usually worsen depression. Altered self worth might make him feel he doesn't deserve your attention, try also to offset this feeling by recalling him from time to time he counts for you. The remaining is more hypothetically helpful, but it could also be more efficient if it lands well. If you know his family well and believe they can treat the situation in an adequate manner you could also warn them something is going wrong. They could on their turn also try to break isolation. Be careful to not break your friend trust doing so, however. You could suggest him to see a therapist if such things are adequate in your culture and are practicaly accessible. I know that many would take offense for being suggested that so take some care choosing your words; try to relate to undeniable facts that lead you to believe he could benefit. Among the activity you could do together, sports can also be helpful in fighting negative thinking. This is what I would have benefited from, in some of my worst periods and I hope it can help you taking care of your friend.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26106","post_title":"How to get close to an old friend, who is struggling with his situation now","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/26106","timestamp":"2020-09-03T06:38:46","char_len":"1814","word_len":"325","lang":"en","label":"positive"}

{"comment_text":"I'm regularly offering food to the homeless people I meet in the streets of my city. Experience taught me that it's not such a good idea to buy the food first and then offer it, since it'd be something that the receiver doesn't enjoy consuming / is allergic to / ... To avoid this situation, I usually come to see them first and tell them: Hi. I have no cash in my purse but I'd really like to offer you something to drink/eat. What can I buy that you would enjoy? The \"I have no cash\" part is unavoidable in my case because I come from a country where cash is not that common anymore and so I rarely have some in my wallet and buy everything with my card. But I realized with time that this disclaiming sometimes make them more comfortable of the idea of receiving food. The remaining part of the sentence indicates your will to please and they will be more inclined to ask for something they like. This is important because you do not want to look arrogant and if you let them the opportunity to choose what you'll offer, you'll help them the most. You need to know that you may encounter a \"picky\" person sometimes. I offered to buy food to the homeless people in front of a grocery store last year, and they asked me for expensive, raw food (e.g. chopped steak, pork ribs, sausages). I was short on money and couldn't afford to buy them a reasonable quantity of meat, which is quite expensive in my country. You need to know you may find yourself in similar situations oftentimes. However, there are different things you can do to defuse them: When you're offering to buy food, you can give examples of what you can buy them (maybe based on what is sold around): Is there something you would like to drink/eat? Hot coffee, orange juice, banana, cookies? Not only it can reduce a bit the shame the receiving person could feel to ask you for food, but also could orientate their choice toward one of the foods you've mentioned. In the case they ask you for expensive food / food that does not meet your religious and ethical beliefs, you can be straight-forward and tell them. I'm sorry, this is not something I can buy. Perhaps this [similar food] would please you too? You're not obliged to disclaim the reason why you don't want/can't buy it, but there's nothing wrong to do it either. Keeping it for yourself could spare you a debate but also make you look arrogant. It depends on what is most important to you. The last thing I want to tell you is that if you're willing to, oftentimes the nicest thing you can do to help them is not only buy them some food but discuss a bit with them. They will really enjoy to spend some time with you, ask you about your job, the reason you're in town today. There's so many people who don't even greet them and pretend they're not here, they will really appreciate the human contact and trust me, you'll also learn from it too.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17082","post_title":"Offering free food to random people as a kind gesture, without being condescending or strange","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/17082","timestamp":"2018-07-30T03:24:49","char_len":"2925","word_len":"535","lang":"en","label":"positive"}

Some kind of epistemological humility concerning complex issues like these is warranted it seems to me.

{"comment_text":"Explain what you're working on that day. This has multiple advantages and is a tactic not only relevant to programming: Talk about what your current issues are, or a nice little pattern and what it solves. You can explain the type of thing you're making, what the challenge is in that part and possible solutions. Also telling the solution the yesterdays problem is useful here. As your problems/solutions change (due to you being ready for the next challenge), it gives a feel for what you're doing. You couldn't progress if all you do is game. This takes a bit of time, but can build trust. Explaning what you're doing is quite a valuable skill in programming. for some, its absolute magic what we do and knowing how to explain to non-peers makes it less magic, which in turn helps a lot politically. It offers insights to peers, who might help you identify your error in thinking, or may offer a solution you didnt think of. Rubber ducking is very valuable \" if you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough \". By explaining what you're doing, you can get a feel for which parts are not second nature for yourself. If you stuggle to explain something, it might be a hint on what you can improve. It allows them to talk about your hobby. They'll likely not understand, but its a small outlet for you and they might get a basic feel of what you're doing. By explaining things often, they might connect at least some dots. And a bit pessimistic: Programming is boring for a lot of people. It could also be they feel bored quickly and leave the subject alone. Not a very enthousiasic response, but one that in the end will also solve your corrent challenge. Apart from the above (which you can/should do anyway), you can ask them what the issue is. I'm dutch, so I'm used to being a bit more direct, but IMO that is a effective method in this cases as miscommunication created the situation, so clear communication is the way out. I feel there is an issue with my computer usage, mainly because there seems to be the assumption I use it to game all the time. Yes I like to game a bit, but not all the time. What is it you want me to tell/show you 1 , as I have the feeling that what I say about my programming studies is disregarded? Would you like a small demo of what I'm working on now? I feel its unfair that, before I show you, you have already decided to distrust it. 1 Say this in a friendly tone. Its a genuine question, not some snappy comeback. You want progress, not offence.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28374","post_title":"How to persuade my parents that I am learning by using computers but not playing games","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28374","timestamp":"2023-07-30T17:49:50","char_len":"2546","word_len":"464","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I don't know if this will work for you. But for a young person who had very rigid right-and-wrong-way-to-do-things opinions, a piece of paper and a pencil in the pocket cured it. When someone does something wrong, make a note of it. Tell yourself you will discuss it with them later, when no-one else is around or when the emotion or pressure of the situation is lower. Tell yourself you will run it by a trusted advisor before raising it with the person who \"did it wrong.\" Let them do it wrong, and make a note. You may find that within minutes you can happily throw the note away. You may find it useful to run through a pocketful of notes with a trusted friend or parent. You may end up using the notes to extract your real issue, your reason for needing to correct them and believing they were wrong. Imagine telling someone simply and honestly \"I felt unimportant when instead of watching a show I was looking forward to as a reward for a day's work, I had to wait for you when you decided there was still some work left in the day. It made me tense. I felt I couldn't control my opportunity to relax.\" That's useful insight anyone who shares a home with you would be happy to hear. Of course, you may realize as you formulate the sentence that your conclusion \"my part of the garage sale is done! Let's all relax!\" may be the problem, and asking her to postpone her last piece (to not be done yet) may have been harder on her than waiting on the tv show was for you.

Usually, when we feel that our proposal may be rejected, we will have an insecurity, and this insecurity will make others insecure as well, and both sides will be dragged into a vicious cycle with no way out. The ability to help each of you discover a new facet of your partner is that both persons work out to find the exact reasons why he likes this and you don't. Why do you feel oral sex disgusting, and why does he like it? What memories bring you two to your current situation? When you have answers for this, you and your husband will be surprised for yourself and each other, and your memories will be appreciated by the other. By getting to the mindset of exploring the other's perspective instead of telling it is bad without reasons, both of you can see the benefits to construct the conversation, instead of having insecurities and having to sugarcoat it. The I-message will be used reflexively, and you will listen mindfully and be curious for a perspective you don't know of, instead of feeling frustrated or attacked.

{"comment_text":"In my dealings with businesses and people in general, I find that sometimes the most tactful approach is also the most direct. Instead of asking, \"Why are there so few reviews?\"--which feels like a grilling--ask instead, \"Where might we see the earlier reviews?\" If you are writing an email or letter, you might say something like the following: Where may we see reviews of the your earlier weddings? We found the reviews on your website for the most recent weddings but we were unable to find any going back more than three months. On your website at (list URL of specific page) you say you have been professionally photographing weddings for ten years. If you could direct us to those earlier reviews, we'd appreciate it very much. A telephone conversation might be similar except you might have to use the title of the page instead of the URL regarding the location of his statement about having been in this profession for ten years. Mentioning the ten years in a non-accusatory manner is vital because: It is the key issue upon which your concern is raised. It catches him off-balance and forces him to account for the missing information. His response will either: a. Give you the location of the missing reviews. or b. Try to distract you from wanting to see them. The reason it usually works to present the situation this way is that it assumes he is an honest and genuine businessman, which allows him to retain his dignity. An honest businessman will apologize for having failed to link to his archived material, or wherever it is, and eagerly make it available to you as potential customers. On the other hand, if he is not a genuine honest businessman, he will have to lie about those missing reviews. Some common ways of \"lying\" are to respond as though he were being grilled. For example, if he gets defensive or angry and/or makes you out as being indecently \"checking him out,\" he is almost certainly running a scam. If he senses that you are a hard case to win, he might even link you to fake \"reviews.\" There is no telling how creative he will be. However, your fiance's concerns about offending him are probably misplaced. If he's honest, he will be apologetic and helpful; if not he will be tense and probably offended no matter how polite and tactful you are.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"24175","post_title":"How to ask potential wedding photographer about low number of reviews","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/24175","timestamp":"2020-02-20T05:01:08","char_len":"2308","word_len":"403","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

But if I know that you are autistic, I donâ€™t understand everything, but I know that you might have problems with things I find normal and that these can be substantial problems. So if you complain about my aftershave I vaguely remember that some autistic people can have bad problems with strong smells. Understanding this, I can use much less or no aftershave. And I might even ask if my strongly smelling cheese sandwich is ok for you. So I think if people know, then most will be much more accepting of complaints. And people not accepting it may be told by their peers that their behaviour is bad, without you having to act yourself.

{"comment_text":"My story is a bit interesting....in 2006 I bought my house for 102k...Then in 2009 my then wife went back to gambling, and scamming. Part of this meant she was not making the house payments, and was communicating with the bank, to keep me from knowing this. However, due to the sudden rise of foreclosures...the last thing the bank wanted was for us to move out.(Wells Fargo) So, we ended up doing a modification, which is basically new terms to your loan. Due to late payments, interest, etc.. In 2010, when we actually signed the modification..we now owed 110k on the same house, we had previously owed 96k on at the time of purchase. One benefit of the modification, was PMI was not part of the new loan, which was at 5% approximately. Payment was just under 1k a month, so, this was still a cheaper option, than moving, cause homes in the neighborhood were selling for as low as 70k. Wife then leaves me.(good riddance) Two days ago, a house one block over was on the market for 350k. I have since refinanced(3% )..and today I owe less than 30k on the house, with a payment just under 900 bucks a month. Thats my story, and I am sticking to it.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/1dny150/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after/","timestamp":"1719291758.0","char_len":"1156","word_len":"212","lang":"en","label":"positive"}

{"comment_text":"Firstly you have to ask yourself what's more important to you: your girlfriend's wishes, or your desire to smoke? If you care more about your girlfriend than smoking, then you need to focus on how best to quit. You will probably find that your girlfriend will be very supportive in your efforts. If, on the other hand, you simply do not want to quit smoking - regardless of your girlfriend's wishes - then this is entirely your choice. But you need to be honest with her about it. You need to tell her directly that you simply don't want to quit. This then becomes a question for her : does she love you enough to accept it and live with it? Of course, you can approach this as gently as you like, and with as much sensitivity in the way you choose your words and the way you speak. But ultimately if your decision is that you don't want to stop smoking, you can not avoid telling her that. If her answer is no, then there will be some heartache, but at least you will both have your answer . What you must not do is lie, by pretending that you quit (or are trying to quit), while actually having no intention to do so. That is utterly unfair on her, because if she doesn't see a long-term future with a partner who smokes, you're effectively stringing her along, allowing her to believe that you have a future when actually you don't. Ultimately it's your decision: nobody can force you to quit smoking. You may do as you please, with your own life. But you need to be honest, and acknowledge that your decisions affect others. From my own experience : I detest everything about smoking. When I met my first girlfriend (over the internet!) I began to feel for her before I discovered that she smoked. I was upfront with her, telling her that I hated smoking. However she avoided the issue , giving the impression that she would eventually quit when the time was right. Over 3 years later, she was still smoking - and I only then realised that she didn't actually want to quit, and she never intended to. If I had known her position at the beginning, then at least I would have been clear that she was not right for me. It was only the hope that she intended to quit, that made me put up with it at the beginning. However, smoking has no place in my future. I was not upset because she chooses to keep smoking. I was upset that she effectively lied to me, meaning that I wasted 3 years of my life with her. (Smoking was not the only reason we broke up - but it's one of the indicative factors showing that she never really cared about my feelings.) You need to be honest with your partner. Always.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"21421","post_title":"Communicating to my partner that I don&#39;t want to stop smoking","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/21421","timestamp":"2019-03-29T18:25:04","char_len":"2629","word_len":"490","lang":"en","label":"neutral"}

This being your birthday, I'd really suggest being transparent about this. You don't want to make it look like you're trying to arrange your friends to take you out for your birthday.

If you can pay, I'd suggest wording the invite like this \"I'd like to celebrate my birthday with you at X. We can meet at [time]; and we can plan on 2 hours.\" Then pay for it when everybody's there. If paying would be hard for you, then word it, \"I'd like to celebrate my birthday with you at X. If we all split the cost, it would come to Y per person\" I generally don't like mentioning cost in an invite because it can sound tacky.

{"comment_text":"The above behavior is happening because of Branch prediction. To understand branch prediction one must first understand an Instruction Pipeline. The the steps of running an instruction can be overlapped with the sequence of steps of running the previous and next instruction, so that different steps can be executed concurrently in parallel. This technique is known as instruction pipelining and is used to increase throughput in modern processors. To understand this better please see this example on Wikipedia . Generally, modern processors have quite long (and wide) pipelines, so many instruction can be in flight. See Modern Microprocessors A 90-Minute Guide! which starts by introducing basic in-order pipelining and goes from there. But for ease let's consider a simple in-order pipeline with these 4 steps only. (Like a classic 5-stage RISC , but omitting a separate MEM stage.) IF -- Fetch the instruction from memory ID -- Decode the instruction EX -- Execute the instruction WB -- Write back to CPU register 4-stage pipeline in general for 2 instructions. Moving back to the above question let's consider the following instructions: A) if (data[c] >= 128) /\\ / \\ / \\ true / \\ false / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ B) sum += data[c]; C) for loop or print(). Without branch prediction, the following would occur: To execute instruction B or instruction C the processor will have to wait ( stall ) till the instruction A leaves the EX stage in the pipeline, as the decision to go to instruction B or instruction C depends on the result of instruction A. (i.e. where to fetch from next.) So the pipeline will look like this: Without prediction: when if condition is true: Without prediction: When if condition is false: As a result of waiting for the result of instruction A, the total CPU cycles spent in the above case (without branch prediction; for both true and false) is 7. So what is branch prediction? Branch predictor will try to guess which way a branch (an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. It will not wait for the instruction A to reach the EX stage of the pipeline, but it will guess the decision and go to that instruction (B or C in case of our example). In case of a correct guess, the pipeline looks something like this: If it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay. The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good branch predictor . In the OP's code, the first time when the conditional, the branch predictor does not have any information to base up prediction, so the first time it will randomly choose the next instruction. (Or fall back to static prediction, typically forward not-taken, backward taken). Later in the for loop, it can base the prediction on the history. For an array sorted in ascending order, there are three possibilities: All the elements are less than 128 All the elements are greater than 128 Some starting new elements are less than 128 and later it become greater than 128 Let us assume that the predictor will always assume the true branch on the first run. So in the first case, it will always take the true branch since historically all its predictions are correct. In the 2nd case, initially it will predict wrong, but after a few iterations, it will predict correctly. In the 3rd case, it will initially predict correctly till the elements are less than 128. After which it will fail for some time and the correct itself when it sees branch prediction failure in history. In all these cases the failure will be too less in number and as a result, only a few times it will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch, resulting in fewer CPU cycles. But in case of a random unsorted array, the prediction will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch most of the time and result in more CPU cycles compared to the sorted array. Further reading: Modern Microprocessors A 90-Minute Guide! Dan Luu's article on branch prediction (which covers older branch predictors, not modern IT-TAGE or Perceptron) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor Branch Prediction and the Performance of Interpreters - Donâ€™t Trust Folklore - 2015 paper showing how well Intel's Haswell does at predicting the indirect branch of a Python interpreter's main loop (historically problematic due to a non-simple pattern), vs. earlier CPUs which didn't use IT-TAGE. (They don't help with this fully random case, though. Still 50% mispredict rate for the if inside the loop on a Skylake CPU when the source is compiled to branch asm.) Static branch prediction on newer Intel processors - what CPUs actually do when running a branch instruction that doesn't have a dynamic prediction available. Historically, forward not-taken (like an if or break ), backward taken (like a loop) has been used because it's better than nothing. Laying out code so the fast path / common case minimizes taken branches is good for I-cache density as well as static prediction, so compilers already do that. (That's the real effect of likely / unlikely hints in C source, not actually hinting the hardware branch prediction in most CPU, except maybe via static prediction.)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":"6049","word_len":"953","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

It regulates the financial world, it invests in technology, it gives agricultural subsidies--it makes a *ton* of decisions in an immense number of specialized fields. The people at the helm--elected politicians--can't possibly be expected to be experts in all these fields at once. That'd be ridiculous. They're also busy people. Lobbying, essentially, is an expert (or a representative of an expert, such as a lobbyist for Boeing) trying to explain to politicians why they should vote a certain way. They pay them because it wouldn't make financial sense for a politician to spend time listening to expert testimony when he could be fundraising. That's it; a corporation pays a politician for the privilege to explain their side of the story. Now, of course, shady lobbying happens. But it's not bribery in and of itself.

{"comment_text":"In your sample conversation, it seems clear to me that \"Person\" didn't ask what you liked about your work in order to find out what you liked about your work. This is why they interrupt your answer - no matter what you answer, they are going to interrupt because they don't care about your answer, they just want to talk. I mostly cut people like this out of my life, but when I do have to spend time with some, I rely on a stock of very short responses that can't be argued with. For example, \"it's fun!\" or \"I'm good at it!\" or even \"More than I could list here!\" These end your turn quickly and let them react or not as they prefer. They can always ask a followup if they truly want to know. This contradicts advice we're often given for interview situations, like repeating the question (\"I like that\") as well as a drive many of us have to be accurate and not exaggerate (\"mostly,\"). You can give those thoughtful and careful kind of answers to people who actually want to hear your answer and care what you say. You can also ignore the question not by standing there silently, but by asking a different one. \"What do you like about your job?\" (an advanced technique is \"oh, you know, so many things, like for example what do you like about your job\".) Or \"how familiar are you with software development?\" Or if you want to flatter them and know something about them, \"I know you're familiar with software development, [pause]\" - in here they can nod and signal you to go on, or launch into a speech if they want. You would be surprised how often people start conversations so they can talk, not because they want to hear what you think.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28921","post_title":"How to pass on a question when you cannot answer efficiently","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28921","timestamp":"2025-01-01T22:19:33","char_len":"1654","word_len":"307","lang":"","label":"negative"}

{"comment_text":"Edited for actual answer, not a ramble I think there's only two ways out of this, a confrontation around an event (or set of events), or working out with your friends for ways around this. It's not the hardest thing to ask \"Will be at the event? You can probably guess I'm not a huge fan of them.\" This also gives an opportunity to open up a discussion between you and the organizer about how you feel. It may turn out well, in that others share your opinions, but you've let your opinion be known regardless. You could also cut short your appearances when that person is around and leave (could include snark for extra dramatic effect - see ramble below). It would become obvious after a while that both of you don't tend to appear at the same time, but this could also start a rift. Ramble I'm reminded of certain public figures and relatives who try to crush your hand in a handshake - there's no point to this, except to show they're a real prick. This person seems like one of those people. Eddie Izzard on \"Hand Squeezy Death\" And some people do one of those squeezy handshakes, the small-dick crusher squeezy handshakes, the compensation handshake....they go into this and you don't react. You should react, because they get away with it, if someone starts crushing your hand, go \"ahhhh! fucking hell! You bastard! I hope you die in a car crash!\" Or do the complete opposite, and collapse on the floor - \"You killed him, man. He suffers from Hand Squeezy Death!\" My take on this is sarcasm, pure, undiluted sarcasm. The cynical side of me says point out your disgust: Usual comments are like \"wow you have really gotten fat\" \"Good point, what is it like then to be only able to buy shitty food? How good is nice food! All the chocolate all the time!\" \"you're useless and should go kill yourself\" \"OK, do you want to make the noose while I get the chair?

{"comment_text":"There are two main scenarios You haven't pushed the commit yet If the problem was extra files you commited (and you don't want those on repository), you can remove them using git rm and then commiting with --amend git rm <pathToFile> You can also remove entire directories with -r , or even combine with other Bash commands git rm -r <pathToDirectory> git rm $(find -name '*.class') After removing the files, you can commit, with --amend option git commit --amend -C HEAD # the -C option is to use the same commit message This will rewrite your recent local commit removing the extra files, so, these files will never be sent on push and also will be removed from your local .git repository by GC. You already pushed the commit You can apply the same solution of the other scenario and then doing git push with the -f option, but it is not recommended since it overwrites the remote history with a divergent change (it can mess your repository).

On the other hand you could say that about a capitalistic system in general that it's a fundamental hindarance for a true democracy, which is true to an extent but also depends a lot of how the actual societal hierarchy looks in practice. The actual problem here is media monopolies, lack of regulation and as a result lack of quality alternatives. As you say a solely government owned media isn't a good option either so wouldn't the ideal be just a more scattered media landscape with a wide range of ownership structures including a public alternative?

{"comment_text":"The issue is, you're approaching what is effectively non-negotiable criterion in a negotiating mindset. You're saying to the person 'I have issue XYZ, can we do this?', and naturally the person will negotiate and offer solutions, even if those solutions are undesirable. If there is only one solution you prefer, you need to offer the social version of a Hobson's choice . So, assuming someone asks if you want to go to the cinema, your response would be: I'd love to go to the cinema, however, due to my condition, there is only one cinema I can go to. Don't worry if you're not able to go there, I just won't be able to attend. Effectively, you're framing the choice as a binary option: we can either go here, or I won't be able to attend. For dietary issues at restaurants, for example, I'd express that I can attend, 'just I won't be able to eat'. By reframing it as 'either we go here or I can't do X', it's no longer about social negotiation but social restrictions, the other cinema excludes you from enjoying the film, and thus your only valid options are XYZ. If the person disputes that, then it boils down to whether it's a valid place for you to attend or if you have to politely decline attendance.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":"1224","word_len":"222","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

The ambiguity is almost intentional here - you can actually use it to strengthen the seriousness of your position. When it comes to eating, the hands are the last part of your body involved in the process that others should expect to be allowed to touch (eg as a handshake) without a clear invitation. While others can expect that you tolerate (you don't need to \"respect\", yo!) their choices in that regard - neither are your choices subject to anyone's judgement.

{"comment_text":"Zelensky didn't try to prevent the conflict through diplomacy because he lacks honor and integrity. In 2014 there was a coup. Soon after, there was a massacre in Odessa (dozens of people were burned alive). Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. A civil war broke out due to the rise in ethnic tensions. For 8 years the Ukrainian military was indiscriminately shelling civilians living in Donbas. If Zelensky honored the Minsk agreement and pledged neutrality, none of this would have happened. The 8 year civil war would have ended and Donbas would have remained part of Ukraine. War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy. Zelensky, Poroshenko, Merkel and Hollande admitted that Ukraine had no intention to honor the Minsk agreements. Who didn't want peace? Who advised against the 2022 peace talks in April? Hint: someone visited Zelensky in Kiev at that time Russia's national security was compromised once NATO began to expand eastwards. Russia clearly stated that Ukraine joining NATO was a red line (November 2021) and unfortunately this concern was never taken seriously. The Russians openly stated: if nothing changes, we will be forced to act in order to defend our national security. Enhancing the national security of one country at the expense of another is unacceptable. The Russians have legitimate security concerns. 20th September, 2021: Ukraine launched military drills with US and NATO. NATO is not a defensive alliance. NATO illegally bombed Yugoslavia (a direct violation of the U.N. Charter). We should never forget what they did to Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq etc. Who blew up the pipeline causing an environmental disaster? Zelensky banned all opposition and arrested a leading priest. Zelensky tried to invoke article 5 under false pretenses. Remember the incident in Poland. Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. Poroshenko said, â€œOur children will go to schools and kindergartensâ€”theirs will hide in the basementsâ€. Russians will never forget the 2014 Odessa massacre. The whole world needs to know about it. Why was Denis Kireev eliminated? He was a member of Ukraine's negotiating team during the peace negotiations. He wanted to help his country. Ukraine has a hit list. They target artists, journalists and ordinary citizens. Hundreds of children are on this list. 13 year old Faina Savenkova was placed on this list. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters is on this list. Jimmy Dore (American stand-up comedian, podcaster) and Aaron MatÃ© (Canadian writer and journalist) are on this list. There is evidence that Ukrainian troops have been indiscriminately shelling civilians in Donbas (they used petal mines and targeted areas where there was no military presence). The azov troops trapped in the azovstal steelworks in Mariupol used human shields. They refused to allow civilians to leave despite of humanitarian corridors being present. Russia held a proposed cease fire in order for the civilians to leave, but azov would not allow the civilians to leave. Ukraine has committed many acts of terrorism (car bombs and other forms of assassination). Darya Dugina (journalist) R.I.P. The first terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge killed the truck driver and the individuals in the adjacent car (innocent civilian victims). The second terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge killed two parents and severely injured their young daughter. I have done a lot of research and it took me a long time to write this comment. I have stated a lot of facts and I have given my honest opinion. I have provided a brief summary of events that took place. In order to explain this whole situation in great detail, a book would need to be written.

{"comment_text":"From a communication point of view, your main problem is excusing yourself and giving an challenge-able explanation, while at the same time acknowledging that other solutions exist. As a person with High-functioning autism, I noticed a lot of(if not all) people have some type of behaviour that's similar or identical Your cinema example is a good way to show HOW NOT TO do that. First, you don't have to explain yourself. Let's go to cinema Y. That's a statement. Plain, simple. The reason why you want Y? It doesn't matter. People have myriad reasons to do things A way, while other would think B is better. Because it smells funny, the cashier looked at me wrong way, you need to turn left instead of right when exiting, they have the wrong kind of butter, my friend once ate there and got food poisoning. This is why I think many people show behaviour similar to autism but it's accepted because it's not explained and excused with autism . Being overloaded with sounds is the same as \"Can you turn radio down?\". Too many people being close to me or rubbing against me is the same as \"I like to go shopping on Wednesday because there are less people\". It's just worded differently. The outcome is the same. If you envision any challenge to, or questioning of, your statement, you can back it with some type of solution. Let's go to cinema Y, we can take my car. Now, if there is any opposition, it would be on the same level as your discomfort. Because that is what it boils down to - discomfort. And when both sides are on the same level, the discussion can commence. If you tell everything at the beginning, you are starting from worst starting point. You're already at the discomfort, that the other side doesn't feel it (yet). Compare it to people sitting. One decides to stand saying \"I prefer to stand\". Their preference, their choice. But if they said \"I will stand because I have hemorrhoids,\" people would joke about it. Some might offer a cushion or a better chair because it was shown as a problem. And problems need solutions. A problems itself can be challenged, \"Does it really exist in the first place?\". Challenging a statement is much harder because the challenger need to bring arguments against it. You give an argument against in your request. Try to think without explaining yourself with autism. Many things are \"socially acceptable\" if you don't give the opportunity to deny their source. Just show the outcome.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":"2480","word_len":"430","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Item by item. Crotch grabbing is fairly culturally normal, because genitals are often itchy. Per this article, many do it. https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a19923835/why-men-touch-their-junk-so-much/ Nose picking and eating is a normal behaviour the majority do. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ijn5h9/caught_bf_eating_boogerswhat_do_i_do/ Not cleaning your teeth is bad, and not good romantic behaviour. Not washing is bad behaviour, and not romantic behaviour. Per this article, eating with your mouth open is widely regarded as disgusting. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/food-manner-mouth-open-a7715411.html Burping is fairly acceptable among most, but farting, especially at dinner or in bed, is seen as worse. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2x129k/my_wife_30f_farts_and_burps_constantly_puts_me/ The more you criticize your partner, the less likely they are to change. So, be wary of how much you push. Think carefully which of these behaviours are ones you have to change, and which ones you want to change. The standard advise for communication is to focus on the present and your feelings. Unfortunately, this often clouds the issue and makes finding mutual understanding and a solution to the current issue less likely, and makes the whole discussion more taxing and even confusing. Try not to bring up past hurts or other topics. Stay focused on the present, your feelings, understanding one another, and finding a solution. So, you could say for example. \"When you don't clean your teeth and don't wash, your breath and body smells and I don't want to kiss you. Please could you clean your teeth regularly and wash with soap, because I find you sexy and want to be with you.\" You should listen to her carefully. If she's depressed, it may be too much effort for her to brush her teeth regularly or shower regularly. As such, you could get her an electric toothbrush, which makes brushing easier, or run her a bath. If it hurts her to not fart, you could help her to the toilet more often. She may well have reasons for her actions you can aid with. Edit. A guide on talking. \"When you pick your nose and eat your boogers in front of me, it makes me feel a bit disgusted and put off, and that drives me away from you.\" This was your suggested way of phrasing it. Some notes. She's not making you feel anything. She can't control your emotions. Be careful when talking about feelings not to blame the other person for your feelings. Say something like \"When you pick your nose in front of me and eat your boogers, I feel disgusted.\" She's not driving you away. Don't blame her for your own behaviour when you talk to her. You're a grown up adult, you can do whatever you want to do including stay or leave. Talk about your feelings, not about how she is forcing you to do actions, unless she is physically forcing you. Try to be a bit positive initially. Rather than using negative words like disgusted say \"I want to spend time with you less.\" and add positive things like \"I'll want to cuddle you more if you avoid that.\"","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"27174","post_title":"Dealing with a depressed partner with personal hygiene issues","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/27174","timestamp":"2021-07-25T01:15:11","char_len":"3166","word_len":"496","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Unfortunately, dating feedback is almost 100% indirect and/or nonverbal. If I know a girl really likes being with me, but I don't like being with her, I'm not going to verbalize it, because it's cruelty. You say you're not adept at picking up social cues. I think you're better at it than you are willing to admit. You just don't like what the social cues mean. No one ever needs to wonder after a date whether the other person wants to continue dating. A simple, \"I really enjoyed our time together the other night. I'd like to see you again. How about tomorrow. We can do such and such.\" If the girl is interested in the guy she will say 'yes'. If she has previous plans, she will break them to be with the new guy. If she puts you off, doesn't answer IMs, or is less than enthusiastic, the message is: \"I don't want to hurt you. But ...\" Just picture how you would respond if she said, \"I really like you! Would you like to go out again?\" She wouldn't feel any different hearing that from you, if she likes you. Picture what you would be willing to do given that comment. Would you be willing to cancel your plans to be with her? Would anything stand between you and being with her? If she sent you an IM, would you answer it? She would feel the same as you do if she likes you. People make a decision about others within five minutes of meeting them. So, learn from experience. Your not going to get a line-item feedback list on any date. If you have to ask her, \"It won't hurt me if you don't, but could you please tell me if you like me or not, and if you don't, could you please provide useful feedback to help me on future dates?\" You've blown any possible hope. That's just not the way it works. By being honest with yourself, and making an honest assessment of your appearance, personal hygiene and body language; you can discover areas that might need work. But no date is going to tell you that stuff. Trust me! I have more experience with dating and women than anyone I've ever met, or even heard of. Each date is either the beginning of a lifelong relationship, or it isn't. Those are the only two things that can happen. Before a girl will accept a romantic date (just the guy and the girl) she must entertain the possibility that there is at least some bridegroom potential. Otherwise, she's wasting her time! The guy in order to ask a girl out must also entertain that there is some bride potential. Otherwise, he wouldn't ask her out! A date is a mutual job interview for the position of spouse. Some people might not like that, but it remains the case.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"13854","post_title":"Gentle way of asking for feedback after the first casual date?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/13854","timestamp":"2018-05-01T08:39:23","char_len":"2603","word_len":"484","lang":"","label":"neutral"}
{"comment_text":"As data is distributed between 0 and 255 when the array is sorted, around the first half of the iterations will not enter the if -statement (the if statement is shared below). if (data[c] >= 128) sum += data[c]; The question is: What makes the above statement not execute in certain cases as in case of sorted data? Here comes the \"branch predictor\". A branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance! Let's do some bench marking to understand it better The performance of an if -statement depends on whether its condition has a predictable pattern. If the condition is always true or always false, the branch prediction logic in the processor will pick up the pattern. On the other hand, if the pattern is unpredictable, the if -statement will be much more expensive. Letâ€™s measure the performance of this loop with different conditions: for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) if (condition) sum++; Here are the timings of the loop with different true-false patterns: Condition Pattern Time (ms) ------------------------------------------------------- (i & 0Ã—80000000) == 0 T repeated 322 (i & 0xffffffff) == 0 F repeated 276 (i & 1) == 0 TF alternating 760 (i & 3) == 0 TFFFTFFFâ€¦ 513 (i & 2) == 0 TTFFTTFFâ€¦ 1675 (i & 4) == 0 TTTTFFFFTTTTFFFFâ€¦ 1275 (i & 8) == 0 8T 8F 8T 8F â€¦ 752 (i & 16) == 0 16T 16F 16T 16F â€¦ 490 A â€œ bad â€ true-false pattern can make an if -statement up to six times slower than a â€œ good â€ pattern! Of course, which pattern is good and which is bad depends on the exact instructions generated by the compiler and on the specific processor. So there is no doubt about the impact of branch prediction on performance!","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":"2105","word_len":"342","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"In the same line (I think this was not highlighted by any answer) it's good to mention that sometimes (specially in software where the performance mattersâ€”like in the Linux kernel) you can find some if statements like the following: if (likely( everything_is_ok )) { /* Do something */ } or similarly: if (unlikely(very_improbable_condition)) { /* Do something */ } Both likely() and unlikely() are in fact macros that are defined by using something like the GCC's __builtin_expect to help the compiler insert prediction code to favour the condition taking into account the information provided by the user. GCC supports other builtins that could change the behavior of the running program or emit low level instructions like clearing the cache, etc. See this documentation that goes through the available GCC's builtins. Normally this kind of optimizations are mainly found in hard-real time applications or embedded systems where execution time matters and it's critical. For example, if you are checking for some error condition that only happens 1/10000000 times, then why not inform the compiler about this?

{"comment_text":"From the perspective of someone with allergies: I'm usually acutely aware of my sniffling, so it can be mildly embarrassing and annoying when someone mentions it. So I'm glad you're being mindful of not putting them in an awkward position! I do not recommend hinting around, like asking \"do you need to blow your nose?\" -- this comes across as very condescending, as if I'm a child who needs to be reminded how to take care of my own body. Instead, if they're sniffling, let them know you have tissues if they'd like one: \"do you need a tissue? I've got some in my bag\". This is a polite offer (maybe I don't have any with me but didn't want to ask) and leaves the choice up to me (not pushy). If they decline, you could hint a little: holding out a tissue, asking \"you sure you don't want one?\" when they start sniffling again. But, be aware that mentioning it repeatedly starts to feel like the first option (and honestly sometimes, like with a cold - I'd rather sniffle a bit than go through a million tissues and sandpaper the skin off my nose). So you'll need to weigh the irritation of listening to their sniffles (and/or if you think they're embarrassing themself in front of others) vs. how much you think they'd be irritated by your request. However, if it's more of a visible problem, you can treat it in the same way you would tell them they had something in their teeth - a quick \"hey, you might wanna blow your nose\", with a discreet gesture to indicate usually gets the message across. This is pretty universally embarrassing, so regardless of feelings about sniffles I've always appreciated being made aware of this.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"422","post_title":"How can I politely ask someone to blow their nose in public?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/422","timestamp":"2017-07-02T08:48:29","char_len":"1645","word_len":"295","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

From a practical standpoint what are you proposing? One of the most successful lobbying groups in US history was the Anti-Saloon League. They did not have money. They were going up against the 5th largest industry in the United States. They did not even have majority support for prohibition at any point prior to its passage. Yet they were powerful because money doesn't buy power. If money bought power Tobacco wouldn't have so many restrictions, Prohibition would never have happened, and there never would have been anti-trust legislation. What holds power is votes. Legislators value one thing above all: their job. Money is one way to help them keep it, but it is a very *very* indirect way to get votes. A pair of 3 million dollar congressional campaigns could easily end up fighting over essentially just 20,000 swing voters. And considering lobbyists, corporations and unions can not donate money *at all* and that PACs can donate at maximum $5,000/election cycle money is in fact a very indirect way of getting influence. Take the NRA for example. Their bank account is actually not that impressive, however they have a mailing list of millions of active voters. A bad grade is enough to cost someone re-election. The NRA has proven this in election after election, when they target someone for defeat they often lose. Bloomberg's group *Mayors Against Illegal Guns* have been badly outspending the NRA all year, but the NRA still won this last go-round. If the victory was simply to the group with the most money we would have passed gun reform. So how can Average Joe American be heard? Get involved. Seriously, it's no more complicated than that. Call your congressperson, you'd be surprised how few they get. Volunteer on a campaign of someone you feel passionately about. If there's a single issue that sticks out, form a group. Broaden it with as many local voters as you can and try to flex your muscle. Yes this requires a commitment of time, and so there will always be some unable to participate, but why should that make the system immoral? Should no one be allowed to participate so long as there are some who are too busy to do so?","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1gquzj","post_title":"I don't believe lobbying is ethically or morally right.

I just did it again and then again again (it's rarely too late to modify your plan if you find the need/want). So, the balancing classes and life is particularly important, but also knowing how to plan your desired college experience is important... though I imagine that it's simpler when you're taking less complex majors. Also, it's important to note that not all majors have equal course loads and the type of assignments can differ from major to major (I haven't really had tests in my majors, instead being paper and project heavy... but other majors have a lot more tests).","platform":"youtube","post_id":"eGR2Yf6yBRA","post_title":"How to Choose a Major | Crash Course | How to College","post_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGR2Yf6yBRA","timestamp":"2022-05-05T22:00:13Z","char_len":"676","word_len":"118","lang":"","label":"positive"}

{"comment_text":"This is easy. You are the problem. Even though they are clearly at fault, saying no is not an option for me because of the consequences of missing the deadline for them. So? Since you are willing to take ownership of their problems with this sort of mentality, they are encouraged and even rewarded in not handling their own responsibilities. Saying no could undermine the friendship. Oh well. If someone is willing to drop you as a friend because you are not available to do their homework for them at the drop of a hat then they were never a friend to begin with. If they choose to end the friendship, then you have done yourself a favor by ridding yourself of a leach in your life. Everyone can come up against an unforeseen issue and require last minute help but this sounds like a pattern and the only common denominator is you. Since you cannot control anyone's behavior but your own, I suggest you start creating some boundaries and learn how to say \"no\". You might ruffle some feathers but that is their problem, not yours. Assuming these people are all adults then it is reasonable to state that they should be able to plan ahead and take care of their own adult problems and tasks. Life is tough and people need to learn hard lessons and it isn't fair for you to be the Winston Wolf in their lives (you might need to look up that reference... lol). At the end of the day, you are actually hurting these people by solving their problems for them because they aren't learning the skills needed to solve their own problems. Remember, no one can ever take advantage of you unless you allow them.

{"comment_text":"This question often arises when people who are not very closely acquainted sit together to eat, and the reasons for it may vary. You could give a specific but brief 'teaser' such as : I was convinced by the arguments of Animal Right Activists/ Studies on the negative impact of the Meat Industry on the environment / any other option. If you eat in company in a setting when each person is responsible for bringing or ordering their food (for example in a workplace cafeteria) then the reason for the inquiry may be that the person is interested is your opinion on people who do eat meat or dairy products. The 'tongue-in-check' comment: \"you must think I'm awful for eating this burger, haha.\" even if not expressed politely is actually a valid concern of a person eating a meat burger in front of a vegan. I would start with setting them at ease and letting them know that you're not there to sit judgement over them for their dietary choices, for example by answering with some cliche, saying: \"No, not at all. Each for his own, it would be terribly boring world if we all had the same opinions.\" If that closes the subject, then the asker was probably not terribly curious about your motivations as for why you chose to be a vegan in the first place, merely was seeking reassurance that the person with whom they share a table is not repulsed by their meal of choice or silently judging them from their moral high ground. If the person persists in their inquiry you should expand on the subject if you wish, but only if they seem to be genuinely curious and open to a productive discussion. If the tone of the conversation becomes passive agressive, defensive or teasing, it's time to cut the conversation on the topic short repeating that opinions may differ and any approach is legitimate, and that you find it not constructive to judge someone on based on dietary choices whether they eat meat or not. Keep in mind that while you researched the subject at length and engrossed by it, your company may not be equally invested. Watch for signs of interest or lack of. Your company may not necessarily be ready to listen to lengthy discussions on the impact of meat production on the environment or the exact statistic of yearly factory livestock farming in your county. If the person's attention seems to falter after a few minutes then probably a change in the conversation topic is warranted. The person may return to the discussion at a later date.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11739","post_title":"How do I answer the question &quot;why are you vegan?&quot; honestly, without making them resent me?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/11739","timestamp":"2018-03-13T16:26:05","char_len":"2494","word_len":"437","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"Giving feedback to someone about the fact they smell can be a bit tricky. That's why I won't talk about that in my answer, especially since Lux Claridge's one do that very well. I'm on the autism spectrum too and I also have anxiety issues. Before I do something, I need it to be planned in advance. For example, if you want me to drive a car, I need to know at least one week before. If my parents want me to visit them, they have to ask (at least) two weeks before. If it's my cousin, it's one week (because she lives closer and it's easier to go to her place). Those restrictions are here because, otherwise, my anxiety would be unbearable. Just the idea of having to take a decision in such \"short notice\" is making my anxiety skyrocket. Like you, at first, people didn't really care (or didn't trusted) that this was causing me so much anxiety. So they keep doing what they were doing with anybody else and asked me stuff within short notice. Since I didn't want to displeasure them, I almost always said \"yes\". But saying those \"yes\" costs me much. I was then very stressed, feeling like I wasn't ready to do whatever activity I agreed to do and mostly didn't enjoy myself while doing those supposedly \"fun\" things. So, at one point, I decided that this had gone on for long enough. If people weren't capable of respecting me, by asking in advance, I wasn't going to say \"yes\" anymore. Thereby, the next time my mother called and proposed I go visit them in three (!) days, I told her: Mom, if you want me to come, you need to ask me at least two weeks in advance. This is too much stress for me otherwise. I won't come. I had to do that with every person who was asking me stuff not enough in advance. And it worked out great. I did have to re-iterate my will to my cousin (she asked me four days in advance, I told her it wasn't enough) but it wasn't a big deal and my cousin apologized for the stress she caused me. So, to answer your actual question: I think, at some point, you have to draw a line. If being able to sit comfortably is important enough for you (and I have the feeling it probably is), then you might want to decide to stop going to the other theater altogether (or decide on what circumstances you are ok with it, and on what you aren't). This will help demonstrate to people how important this is for you which, in return, will help you see your desires/needs respected. I used this same technic for other things where people weren't taking me seriously and it always helped.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":"2550","word_len":"473","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"This was well received by the maker, we continued our chat via private messenger and I gave her more advice (...) She also showed me some tricks (...) So your feedback seems to have been well received and led to an interesting discussion in which you and her learned something new. Perhaps you even made a friend. Very good. Now, there are several kinds of communities like this: The community you (and her) thought you were in, where people ask for feedback in order to improve. Said feedback will sometimes be negative (the sandwich method works wonders). In fact, suggestions for improvement are the most useful kind of feedback. The level of negativity will of course depend on the community. For example I frequent a French electronics forum where the occasional clueless newbie comes in asking about how to build a high power railgun or how to play with lithium polymer batteries. Since this will most likely result in electrocution or fire, the answers aren't usually very \"nice\"... On the opposite side of the spectrum, I know a few people who are fanfiction authors, and when they get any kind of feedback sandwich, they're usually very flattered that someone was interested enough in their work to take the time to think about ways to improve it. In fact they often even beg for feedback. The other kind of community is the \"participation trophy\" one. In this case, people only come in to get a pat on the back and an ego boost, not to improve in their craft. I suspect you wouldn't be interested in this kind of community... The pet community which exists only as a means for the owner to socialize, exert authority, boost their ego, etc. I removed your post. We want people to be nice. That means you can't criticize other peoples crafts. Well, your mistake was simply that you both thought you were in the first kind of community, whereas the moderator thought you were either in the second or third, or both at the same time. In my opinion, being \"nice\" means helping others, even if it means some tough love. In her opinion, being \"nice\" means keeping everything proper and tidy with a complete absence of any conflict whatsoever. Please picture a Dolores Umbridge type character meticulously ironing out the kinks in her tablecloth. The reply that came to this message is still puzzling me today (...) \"We shouldn't have to put such things in a group rule. It's common sense and good manners!\" So, \"We shouldn't have to put such things in a group rule. It's common sense and good manners!\" -- this fits the character. Additionally, nebulous or imprecise rules allow a more liberal interpretation, which increases the moderator's power. You can't appeal to a vague rule. Also consider her stern tone and unwillingness to discuss matters with you. She sounds like she's correcting a misbehaving child. I understand your annoyance... Does it go against netiquette to provide constructive feedback in a Facebook group? Nope. If not, how do I explain so to the moderator and ask them to put something up in their rules so other people won't make the same mistake, without a risk of getting kicked from the group? If my characterization is accurate, you won't be able to. But you can always emphasize that helping people improve can't be done without pointing out what needs improvement, which means that constructive criticism is unavoidable.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"6817","post_title":"Does it go against netiquette to give constructive feedback on Facebook?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/6817","timestamp":"2017-11-16T07:57:52","char_len":"3413","word_len":"576","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"If you are curious about even more optimizations that can be done to this code, consider this: Starting with the original loop: for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { for (unsigned j = 0; j < arraySize; ++j) { if (data[j] >= 128) sum += data[j]; } } With loop interchange, we can safely change this loop to: for (unsigned j = 0; j < arraySize; ++j) { for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { if (data[j] >= 128) sum += data[j]; } } Then, you can see that the if conditional is constant throughout the execution of the i loop, so you can hoist the if out: for (unsigned j = 0; j < arraySize; ++j) { if (data[j] >= 128) { for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { sum += data[j]; } } } Then, you see that the inner loop can be collapsed into one single expression, assuming the floating point model allows it ( /fp:fast is thrown, for example) for (unsigned j = 0; j < arraySize; ++j) { if (data[j] >= 128) { sum += data[j] * 100000; } } That one is 100,000 times faster than before.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":"1148","word_len":"202","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I communicate a lot online, especially in chatrooms - often on Stack Exchange chat itself, or Discord, or similar platforms, and have been using these platforms to communicate for years. I'm often sarcastic - I like incorporating sarcasm into my communication, and it doesn't help that I like to at times provide \"comic relief\" of sorts. I'm used to people assuming that what I'm saying is sarcasm, because a lot of the time, it is. A good way that I've found to differentiate between when you're being sarcastic and when not is to incorporate a specific writing style for being sarcastic, and a different one for being serious. This happened rather naturally for me, simply as a result of being misunderstood a bit too often - it sort of developed as a defense mechanism. If I'm being sarcastic, I'll often trail off sentences with an ellipsis at the end, and in general adopt a dry, familiar tone. Emphasis on words like \" much better\" also helps with replicating normal tones for speaking sarcastically. Throwing in emojis like \";)\" are also commonplace. Speaking in absolutes also often gives a sarcastic tone. Compare: Sure... ;) Yeah, it would've been much better if they'd have killed her off at the end... vs Sure. Seriously, it would've been better if they had killed her off at the end - it would've resolved the storyline with this guy, and given some resolution to the character. When I'm not being sarcastic, my tone gets less dry. I sound more like I mean what I'm saying. Drop the emojis. Drop the ellipsis at the end. Sound more \"serious\". Flesh out what you're saying. For extra benefit, throw on a \"seriously\" at the beginning, especially if you're switching from being joking / sarcastic to being serious, or use another similar method (\"on a more serious note\", \"to be serious for a sec\", etc). What you wrote - \"I agree. Especially if your anime were going to be filler-ridden anyway\" - has several things in it that make it sound like you're being sarcastic. First off, you wrote \"I agree\". That immediately sounds sarcastic. (I'm not even sure why, but it does. It for some reason immediately gives me the impress that you're not being serious.) If I were you, I'd've thrown on a \"seriously\" at the beginning. Second, you're degrading the thing you're talking about, in a way. \"filler-ridden\" gives the impression that you're being sarcastic because you're putting it down without explaining what you mean, or giving your reasoning. If I were in your position, I would have gone for something more like this. Seriously, I agree. It already has lots of filler in it, which is Toei's specialty, so it would actually be a good idea. While there's still the possibility of this being misinterpreted as being sarcastic, from my experience this will be much less likely now that you're explaining your reasoning, and leading with something (\"seriously\") that should explicitly tell them that you're not being sarcastic. While there's no sureproof way to make sure that you're never taken sarcastically when you're not, in my experience, the best way is to adopt a certain way that you use to communicate in each instance, and avoid using communication methods that are usually seen as sarcastic when you're being serious. This will work best with people who you communicate with often and have learned your style of communication, but I've had success in using my two methods of communication even with people who I am not in regular contact with. As an aside, cultural and language barriers often play an often underestimated role when it comes to sarcasm and communication on the internet. People who don't speak English as a first language often have a hard time picking up on the subtleties that come into play in English, and people who do speak English as a first language sometimes read stuff into other people's messages that the person who wrote the message didn't mean at all. Other cultural considerations, such as not generally using sarcasm at all, can also have an impact on understanding. It's something to keep in mind. Always be ready to explain yourself, and don't be too quick to jump to conclusions, especially if the other person isn't a native speaker.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"22471","post_title":"How can I indicate that what I&#39;m saying is not sarcastic online?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/22471","timestamp":"2019-07-22T04:25:28","char_len":"4263","word_len":"717","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"(Moving my comment to a full-fledged answer) As well as designating someone/thing, a pointed finger may also be an accusatory gesture. Without any context, the person being pointed at (or people witnessing you pointing at people) might believe youâ€™re accusing instead of designating, and being accused is widely felt as defaming (however justified or not. The \"Il nâ€™y a pas de fumÃ©e sans feu\" effect is in full force here). However, itâ€™s dependant on each personâ€™s sensibility, experience, upbringing, etc. For instance, your coworker didnâ€™t mind the pointing, while your manager did. It is therefore more prudent/socially acceptable to refrain from pointing unless youâ€™re certain that people around wonâ€™t take it as accusatory . Please note that there are different ways to point at people/things, and they do not convey the same meaning : Pointing straight at someone with a straightened index, closed fingers, and horizontal, straightened arm (from the shoulder) is the most accusatory version of pointing, especially at someoneâ€™s face. On the contrary, an open hand, facing up, with bent elbow, gesturing towards someoneâ€™s torso is much less accusatory and much more designating (it has a \"For instance, this person/thingâ€¦\" meaning). Also, pointing at inanimate objects is usually fine. They donâ€™t have feelings that can be hurt by being (falsely) accused. :-)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26102","post_title":"Why is it socially not acceptable to point at someone with your finger?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/26102","timestamp":"2020-09-02T13:01:12","char_len":"1382","word_len":"214","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I had a boyfriend once that had an habit that went against my customes too. This is how I dealt with it. First you don't need to feel guilty, maybe he doesn't care about hygine , which btw doesn't sound like you are an extremist, just pretty standard behavior, while he is on the extreme of uncleaness in the modern world, but you do . THAT is how you are, it is part of your personality. You have the right to decide if it is important for you or not. In my case I had the same problem, I felt maybe I was being too picky. My boyfriend was nice, we got along pretty well. He loved me, and I was willing to lose all that because one thing? Well, even if it is the most stupid thing ever, you have the right to do it. You decide what is important for you . Not someone else. Lets say you let this slide, how are you going to feel in in 2 more years, in 5 years, in 10 years. How are you going to feel when all the other good things may not feel soo good anymore? You are going to feel like you wasted time, like you were stupid for betraying what was important for you, etc.. Think it the other way around, he is willing to push you away because he doesn't want to take a shower and brush his teeth? Is really that much to ask? If it is not important for you, give it up, and start being not clean also. This is clearly not the case. Maybe you 2 are not compatible. I think it was a red flag that he let you clean everything for him and his friends. As your mom said, you are not his mom, you are partners. Where is he partnering in this whole story? And he even let you clean for his friends? I mean I can understand he being lazy, but he wasn't upset that you had to clean and cook for a bunch of other guys? One thing is doing it once in a while, but the way you describe it, it was like a cleaning job without pay. A relationship is a partnership . Expecting everything to go perfect all the time, is unrealistic. But it is also unrealistic to think every single human being is compatible with every other single human being. I know it is sad, but it is the way it is. I don't know if you work and if he works, but depending how much time you guys have available in the day , do you realize it can be considered truly abusive that you have to drive every day 30-40 to cook for him, clean for him and then back to your house where you cook and clean for yourself? I understand if you do it to help him, because he works too many hours and you have more free time. Or because you really like doing it. But you have to be aware that what you are doing there is a lot of work, and he needs to appreciate it. If he can't even be bothered to wash his teeth to kiss you, that is a red flag. Love yourself, who you are, your values, the way you are with other people . You don't have to feel sorry or guilty for asking him to change something that is causing you a lot of distress . From what you describe you have been more than tolerant and if you have fun with him, I would expect that he is having fun with you. You go out of your way to help him. What does he do for you? So, why did I say all of this? Well is so you prepare mentally. You can't go and talk to him like who says \"I am sorry for being soo annoying and picky\". You need to be sure about this. Imagine staying with him for many years without him changing at all, how are you going to feel? Once you made up your mind and feel totally sure about the importance of him changing this you need to have a talk with him. Set a time, without other peope to bother you, have a nice relaxing setting . Make sure you will have time and no one is going to show up and interrupt you. If you decide to do it at night, prepare dinner and before eating you discuss it. If the results are unsatisfactory, you leave and since you already cooked you won't feel guilty he won't have anything to eat. Sit close to him and look at him right in the eyes . It helps if you touch him while you speak, but don't hug him, he is not a child. A light touch here and there or whatever you feel comfortable with. You have to feel close but also there has to be a certain distance. The goal is to make him see you are not judging him, and you love him, and want to be with him . That is why you are sitting close to him. And also that you are serious, that is why you are not smooching . If he tries to derail the conversation getting more phisical stop him. And if he insist leave and tell him you are going to talk more another day. He needs to see you are serious. Then you say something like (lets say he is called John): John, I love you, I enjoy spending time with you and I want to keep doing it. And I think you feel the same for me. Here is better if he doesn't interrupt, but if he wants to say he does or so. It is ok. There is something that is really important for me, I think you know what I mean. I understand you and I are different, you are more relaxed in certain things and your job makes you get dirty way more than mine does. I understand that you can't arrive home squeaky clean. I understand you have some work clothes that are probably going to be not as clean as I would like it. I truly understand and respect that. Is important that you don't judge him, he is the way he is, he also has a right to be that way . It is his decision, it is not your place to judge him or change him. That is why you shouldn't say things like \"you have a problem with hygine\". Because from his point of view, the one with the problem is probably you. You can not change the other person, you can say what is important for you and then, if they want, they can change. So then you state what you feel. As I usually say in my answers, don't ever use \"but\" or \"however\" after anything positive you said. For example if you just said you understand and respect him, if then you say \"but xxxx\" you are taking away from what you said first. So the next ideas shouldn't be a but, they should be \"this is how I feel\", he doesn't make you fee things, he does things and you have feelings over those things. This difference is rather important. I need you to take me seriously on this subject. In this two years we have been together, I don't feel you have. As I said, I understand we are different, so please understand me too. When you haven't brushed your teeth in two days, I don't feel like kissing you, I just can't, and It kills me because I really love you. When you don't shower after being out in the country all day, and you are covered in mud and you want to make love, I don't feel motivated, it makes me feel less attracted to you. I don't want to feel this way anymore. The idea here is to describe how what he does makes you feel, without blaming him. He does X you feel Y . What you feel is not his responsability. So you realized he does things that make you feel in ways you don't like. Therefore you communicate this to him and ask him to change otherwise you will have to leave. Then you ask him if he wants to change: I realize now that I will always feel this way, if you don't brush your teeth I won't feel inclined to kiss you and if you don't shower I won't feel as attracted to you. And I think if we continue this way we are going to be unhappy and maybe even get to hate each other. I don't want that. So, I ask you today, do you think you want to change those things? If you don't want to, if you feel you can't, or that doing that would be betraying yourself; please tell me. I am not asking you to change for me. I am asking you to change because you want. If you don't want it, that is alright, I understand it. I need an honest answer, don't feel obliged to say you want to change, because as I said I don't want to start hating each other, and I don't want to be crying anymore about this. You are my best friend and I want us to remain friends. So be honest with yourself and with me. Then you wait to see what he says. It is important that he doesn't do this for you . He has to do it because he wants , otherwise in the future he will say \"i did this for you\" and he may resent you. That is also why you don't tell him \"change or I will leave\". If he says he will change , that he wants to change because he loves you and wants yout o feel attracked to you. Then you tell him that you are glad and you are going to help him change if he wants . For example when he gets home you can start the shower, or whatever. But stop acting like his mom. You can get in the shower with him, the way you help him has to be playful, not like a job or duty. And it shouldn't be every time. If after a while he doesn't change, leave him, because he won't change and he probably lied so you wouldn't leave him. If he says he can't change , that he would like to change but he realizes he can't. Then you tell him that you understand and appreciate his honesty because is going to save you both a lot of hardship. You tell him you love him and leave . And since you had dinner ready already you won't feel so bad. Leave right away and tell him you will get in touch with him later to get your stuff. Don't get in touch right away, it is better if you let some time pass so when you talk to him again you won't feel inclined to say \"I am sorry lets get together again\". If he later contacts you or when he sees you, he says he is going to change . Well that is up to you to accept. If you accept do as I said above on the option \"if he says he will change\". Don't let keep going on forever . If he does change, take into account, that later on he may relapse . If he says he did this because you pushed him to do it, break up. You will have to monitor the relationship, so you don't get stuck forever if he really is not willing to change. I think, with some luck he will want to change because that kind of behavior is going to affect his life in general. If he doesn't change or want to change, it is not your fault . Don't see it as something wrong in you. That is on him. People don't change for other people, they change for themselves. Just be sure to get closure . Once you decide it is going to be the end, you can give him one retry, like I said above, but only if you really feel like it. Some people break a relationship, but don't give the other people closure. He could say something like \"now I can't change but maybe in the future\". That is a way to make you wait for him. Don't let that happen. Once is done, be done, close that door and don't expect him to come crawling . Otherwise you will be lovesick forever. I did this in my relatioship, but my boyfriend really didn't want to change . He told me so later on. I didn't notice that at the time, I realized later on, when it was too late and we had wasted time and the relationship had deteriorated so we couldn't even remain friends. That is why is important that he changes because he wants, not because you ask.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23562","post_title":"My boyfriend has issues with hygiene","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/23562","timestamp":"2019-11-23T17:29:12","char_len":"10982","word_len":"2201","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"why is it that society finds it rude to point at people? What's the harm in doing that? There have been many useful answers. My answer may not be entirely new but I shall try to introduce new factors. Culture Gestures are generally culture-dependent. For example showing the soles of your feet/shoes is very disrespectful to some cultures and not to others. I discovered this when I had a girlfriend of a different culture to mine. I just had to learn this fact. It did not seem necessary to enquire why. I made sure I did not show the soles of my feet to her or her family. (for example by putting my feet up on a footstool) Britain In Britain, and I suspect many other English-speaking countries, pointing is used mainly to indicate inanimate objects. If I point at a person, there is some implication that I think of them as an object rather than a human-being with thoughts and emotions. Note that there can be more subtle differences. For example, at a party or meeting, it is impolite to point. However if you saw an amazing street-performer, say a juggler or acrobat, then it is acceptable to point to direct a companion's direction of gaze. It is however understood that you are pointing to the activity (throwing juggling balls) rather than at the person. In practice it is difficult to see the difference. If you are speaking to an individual, then the fact you address them as \"you\" is enough for them to know that you are speaking to them and not someone else. Therefore pointing is considered unnecessary as well as impolite.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26102","post_title":"Why is it socially not acceptable to point at someone with your finger?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/26102","timestamp":"2020-09-02T13:01:12","char_len":"1556","word_len":"275","lang":"","label":"neutral"}

{"comment_text":"I think there are several different areas where you could aim to make progress. It is only based on a small amount of information, so please correct me if I am wrong. It sounds like your self-esteem, especially with respect to dating, is not very high. You don't get out enough to meet new people, and make contact with them. You are not very skilled in interactions with members of the opposite sex. These points seem quite independent, but they are actually strongly related. Improving any of these points also improves the others. If you are more confident, it is much easier to contact new people. If you are that social guy who jokes a bit with everyone at a party, girls will want to get to know you and come to you. If you enjoy life, and have a lot of fun, people want to be around you, we all want to have fun right. Maybe you can try to improve yourself in fun way. Diet can also mean eating more healthy, and you can also lose weight and improve your health with new activities/sports. That is also a great way to meet new people and improve your social skills. Try: Registering for a cooking course and/or club. A great way to have fun, become more healthy and meet people at the same time. Also a great activity on a date. Find nice activities or sports to do. The most important thing is that you enjoy it. Try new things, also things very different from what you usually do. You could force yourself to try something completely new every second week. It can be especially nice if you can bring a buddy with you. I am a typical guy guy, engineer, my favorite sport was kickboxing. But a friend dragged me to bikram yoga class, and I enjoyed it so much I registered. Never would have thought that, and I actually smirked and made fun of it quite a bit when she suggested it. Try some club or group to meet new people. When I moved to a new city and country I joined some groups at meetup.com. I met new people and had a lot of fun. There is something for everyone there; book clubs, wine clubs, cooking clubs and going to bars clubs. Or try some gaming related clubs, I think they are also out there. Last but not least, about social interaction with the opposite , I can highly recommend finding some information about something called the PUA, or pick-up artist community. This is a group of nerdy, analytical people, who have made it their mission to dissect the game of courting/flirting and romance in an understandable and almost technical way. I found it very enlightening and it helped me improve my social skills and understand people much better. The book 'the game' by Neil Straus describes how he came in to contact with it, became obsessed with it and got very good at it. It also describes all the facets about it in some detail. I found it very entertaining to read too. Be a bit careful with it though, some people almost get addicted to it, and there are also some weirdo's and creeps who are in to it. Never loose yourself, and always treat other people with respect. Good luck with your quest, and most importantly, have fun!","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17786","post_title":"How to ask for dating advice?","post_url":"https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/17786","timestamp":"2018-08-21T14:09:25","char_len":"3097","word_len":"565","lang":"","label":"positive"}

The telescope is such a monumental leap in technology and it would allow the scientists to see things that were previously never seen before. Personally, I still have a special place for the Hubble Space Telescope, mainly because it was launched when I was a kid and had just started to become interested in astronomy and space exploration. I remember the first images from Hubble being terrible due to the slight deformation of the mirror because the scientists hadnâ€™t considered the effects of microgravity on the shape of the primary mirror. The astronomy community was so disappointed and the media was calling the mission a failure, which was ridiculous, but it was definitely an embarrassment for NASA. However they sent a team up to the telescope to install a software modification to basically adapt the optics like whatâ€™s done by the ground based telescopes. The images were astounding.
