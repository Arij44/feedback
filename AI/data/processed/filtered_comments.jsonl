{"comment_text":"In general there are a bunch of use cases people can use web scraping on. Some examples could include: Market and Pricing Intelligence - Many people have a vested interest in selling goods on Amazon and knowing the market is super helpful. E-commerce in general and studying how you're products compare in rank to others. Ticket Scrapers - it's illegal in most areas to use automated bots to buy tickets, but scraping prices and then manually buying and reselling can be lucrative. Though I despise how these big ticket companies have made this a thing. Travel sites - I'd bet big that the big travel sites with flights scrape each other to find the best prices on things. Public Record Collection - Governments have public data, it can be scraped. You got public Electricity maps, public court stuff, public weather news list goes on. Non profit stuff such as monitoring social media for hate speech. In law you could extend this to world trade and traffic protection where you try to find companies online infringing on the rights of other companies. So in terms of what can be done there, there is a bunch.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1ivijdi","post_title":"Any product making good money with web-scraping?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/webscraping\/comments\/1ivijdi\/any_product_making_good_money_with_webscraping\/","timestamp":1740230309.0,"char_len":1117,"word_len":194,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Even the most garbage 2012 chromebook can run python and java environments, heck, you could use a particularly powerful graphing calculator and it'd work fine. I'd start out by downloading Godot and looking through tutorials there, there are a ton of resources on youtube\/the Godot forums for learning. Follow a tutorial, make a simple game before you try one of your own ideas. Otherwise you'll just burn out immediately. Godot runs on a language which is basically python, don't worry about java or javascript until you've gotten the hang of thinking like a programmer (you'll understand what it means once you've reached it). It's gonna be a mix of really frustrating and really gratifying, don't give up. People will be rude and dismissive. Don't lash out, try to look past the assholery and see the advice buried under there. There's a great community, even if a lot of the loudest voices are needlessly cruel, you'll find the nice people sooner or later. You've got this. (Java and Javascript are entirely different languages, for entirely different purposes - you're definitely thinking of java. In my (somewhat controversial) opinion, python is a much easier jumping in point than either of them, and honestly, easier to create games in than Java.)","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1iwcsc7","post_title":"What laptop should I get if I would like to start learning different coding languages","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CodingHelp\/comments\/1iwcsc7\/what_laptop_should_i_get_if_i_would_like_to_start\/","timestamp":1740325016.0,"char_len":1258,"word_len":208,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I think we're going to see a surge in AI-Assistants and particularly AI-driven processing in business now that the technology is becoming more widespread and more mature. I think most of us don't really have a perspective on the true capabilities of Neural Network driven Learning models, we play with toys like ChatGPT and other generative AI, but the actual AI-lab stuff is *leagues* ahead of any of those. The actual LLMs set up to do a specific job are *really* good at it. Not the garbage \"Write me a short story about X, Y and Z\" stuff, or \"Do my homework\" crap where it's really obviously AI because the bot isn't really built for this specific use-case. Properly trained and targeted LLMs are exceptional in their capability, and we're going to see more and more of that in action. A huge amount of jobs are performed by people who are, and I say this with respect to the skills and knowledge they have to learn, following effectively a flowchart and a script. Any judgement calls are done following rules, not heart or spirit. Their jobs can absolutely be done by an AI if you train it sufficiently. The biggest obstacle to AI taking over people's jobs is that the systems and tools those jobs involve are not set up to support an AI-driven approach. Soon, someone is going to make a decent generalised AI-Application for business-use which can be given control of a mouse and keyboard and the ability to screen-read, and it will *destroy* a huge swathe of the job-market practically overnight. On the less Doom-and-gloom side, I think we're going to see a lot more of things like Google's new Gemini. Expect personal assistant AIs that can meaningfully learn stuff about your likes, dislikes, preferences and habits, and can help you manage your life. Expect an AI you can have an ongoing personal relationship with, (not in the romantic sense, though that's already here), where the AI remembers previous conversations, and can respond in a very human way when you ask questions. I'm imagining such things being particularly useful for supporting people who otherwise have nobody looking after them. Old Folks for example, who might benefit from being able to ask the AI to call someone and tell them something, or need someone to remind them to take their medications, I think the line between members of the household, and the AI assistant are going to be increasingly blurred as time goes on.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1hebeoz","post_title":"What do you think is going to be the next \"big topic\" of all tech industry like is Al now and like blockchain has been years ago?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Futurology\/comments\/1hebeoz\/what_do_you_think_is_going_to_be_the_next_big\/","timestamp":1734207267.0,"char_len":2436,"word_len":416,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"From what I've seen, the timeline is more or less like this: COMPUTER...robots...INTERNET...robots...SOCIAL NETWORKS...robots...AI\/AGI...ROBOTS This timeline begins in the last century with the creation of the first computers that started major technological and process advances. Then the big thing was the internet changing everything with globalization, this was real and the world didn't pay much attention, until things really started to change in the world. Shortly after the internet, which was just a means, came social networks that profoundly changed how people thought and communicated, nothing was ever the same again. Well, the current big thing is AI\/AGI, which is great. I hope we can achieve AGI before 2030, and at most 2035. Following the logic that each of these things was necessary for the creation of the great things that followed (only with the computer were we able to create the internet, only with the internet were we able to create social networks, only with social networks were we able to create AI. Well, in fact, I think that the social network contributed more to the hype for AIs than anything else, and with increasingly faster and more efficient AIs, we will be able to have good enough robots), and looking more closely, robots (as well as AIs) have been recurring subjects since the creation of the computer, but only a few years ago did it become truly achievable.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1hebeoz","post_title":"What do you think is going to be the next \"big topic\" of all tech industry like is Al now and like blockchain has been years ago?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Futurology\/comments\/1hebeoz\/what_do_you_think_is_going_to_be_the_next_big\/","timestamp":1734207267.0,"char_len":1410,"word_len":230,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"There's a chance that the universe exists in an unstable state, where the laws of physics are fine, but not as efficient as they could be. The example you'll see is a ball at the top of a hill. It's probably fine up there, but if something came along and hit it, it would roll down the hill to the next lowest, flattest point. It is possible that something could change at the quantum level that puts existence into a more energy stable state, after which the laws of physics and everything we know will change. This will cause the entirety of existence to be altered in unfathomable ways, but the most likely result for us is that everything about us will cease to exist.

You are not more important to them than their profits. And individual belief does not figure anywhere.

Now if the company fires person B. Now, since B is as good as A, the fired person B decides to create a a competing react app. He can do this because since AI allows the company to create the same app with one person, AI also helps person B to create a competing app alone. What is the result? The result of this will be that people will become more efficient. And more companies will be started faster and cheaper. And this will also mean that you will now be able to create your own startups without outside funding. This also means that you can solve more problems and create companies of the future because creating software, is easier. Don't think of this as a bad thing.

Spark ideas at work and school - it may be tough to have a direct impact globally but it's very possible on a small scale! 5. Hold politicians accountable - lobby, vote, call your reps. 6. Reduce your footprint and most importantly, amplify it by talking about it. (ie I took the train instead of flying and it was lovely! I love my induction stove!

{"comment_text":"Model behavior to friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, etc. Be cool about it. Tell people why you're making the choices you're making. No beef. Minimal meat. (Or vegan). No lawn. No flying. More biking. More public transit. More thrift shop clothes. More estate sale home goods. Even, yes even, paper straws. Here's why. Nobody writes a member of Congress or the editor or goes to the town council meeting or attends a protest or participates in a boycott unless they have enough skin in the game to have fuel for righteous indignation and moral outrage. The human psychology is, \"I'm doing all this and you're not even helping?!\" But if someone is doing nothing, then you need a moral foot in the door. That's where bullshit like paper straws come in. For people who aren't taking any action, they need a tiny first step. A tiny shift in their identity that says, \"I'm someone who cares enough to change my behavior.\" Once you have a tiny toehold, whether it's an LED lightbulb or a single native plant or a paper straw, you can build from there. Do we need corporations to change? Hell yes. Do we need to pressure Congress for regulations? Yes. But the corporations own Congress. We all know it. So the change from that arena is going to be slooooooow. And we're almost out of time. Americans can get onboard with trends. So if enough friends, families, coworkers and neighbors start changing their behaviors, that's a trend. Others will notice and it will grow exponentially. And we can still fight for a carbon fee. And restrictions on private jets. And all that. But for my money, working on our social and community circles is a quicker change that can be contagious.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dkorpf","post_title":"As an individual what do you feel is the most effective action you can take against climate change?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ClimateOffensive\/comments\/1dkorpf\/as_an_individual_what_do_you_feel_is_the_most\/","timestamp":1718923529.0,"char_len":1686,"word_len":293,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"For me, being a so-called doomer is pragmatic, and for a simple reason. For well over 50 years now, scientists have been telling us to reduce consumption\/emissions. We, as a whole, have responded by increasing consumption\/emissions. We've reached the point where the latest IPCC has said that the only thing which can save us is \"fast, deep cuts\", and there's no sign that will happen.

{"comment_text":"This is all true. At this point there's absolutely nothing we can do to stop runaway climate change. It's exponential, irreversible and out of our control. You'll just have to accept your own death and the death of every other lifeform on this planet. In order to understand how even a small change in the level of carbon in the atmosphere can have a big effect on the global average temperature, we must view the Earth\u2019s climate history. For the last 800,000 years the Earth\u2019s climate has been a consistent system. The atmospheric CO2 concentration has constantly been fluctuating between 180 and 280 parts per million. In the peak of an ice age it has been 180 ppm and in the peak of an interglacial warm period it has been 280 ppm. Thereby a difference of just 100 ppm represents two totally different worlds and for nature it is a process that takes thousands of years to adapt to this change. At present rate we are now emitting the equivalent amount of CO2 that makes the difference between an ice age and a warm period in just 35 years and the rate is still increasing. When man started burning oil, coal and natural gas in the 1800\u2019s, the level of atmospheric CO2 concentration was standing at 270 ppm. Now it\u2019s already at 420 ppm and is increasing at a fast pace. This graph illustrates the scale of the enormous imbalance that man has induced into the natural system: [https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/uploads\/2020\/08\/co2-concentration-long-term-1-768x542.png](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/uploads\/2020\/08\/co2-concentration-long-term-1-768x542.png) In Earth\u2019s history there have been five major mass extinction events, where most of the contemporary species on the planet died out. The worst of all these has been the Permian extinction event 252 million years ago, when 70 % of terrestrial species and 96 % of marine species went extinct. The Permian extinction nearly wiped out all life on Earth, and it took 10 million years for life to flourish again. It is reasonable to presume that the sixth mass extiction event, the upcoming Anthropocene extiction, will be worse than these historical mass extintion events, since in these prior mass extinctions the average annual release of CO2 was as low as one billion tons, even a little less. Today, human activities are pumping out the gas at a rate around 40 times faster. In the past mass extinction events, the pace of warming was also much slower and took thousands or even tens of thousands of years, as you can see from this picture: [https:\/\/thecottonwoodpost.files.wordpress.com\/2019\/12\/emissions-rate-1.jpg](https:\/\/thecottonwoodpost.files.wordpress.com\/2019\/12\/emissions-rate-1.jpg) I'm sorry to say this, but hopium is overrated and there's nothing that can save us from extinction at this point.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"125g1c1","post_title":"A critique of the WaPo article : Why climate \u2018doomers\u2019 are replacing climate \u2018deniers\u2019","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/collapse\/comments\/125g1c1\/a_critique_of_the_wapo_article_why_climate\/","timestamp":1680073846.0,"char_len":2782,"word_len":436,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Yeah it's like there is a \"horseshoe theory\" developing for climate - people start to argue that doomers and deniers are essentially the same. See for example here: https:\/\/twitter.com\/_HannahRitchie\/status\/1635964777062182914 I think this is generally bs (just like the left-right horseshoe theory, which has been debunked like a thousand times but still is taken seriously by some people). Some of the most driven activists I know are essentially doomers - they just find it a moral imperative to do as much as possible, either on a societal level (climate activism\/civil disobedience) or on a community level (mutual aid, guerrilla gardening, that kind of stuff). To say that these people are the same as deniers who have demonstrated to be funded\/misled by industry interests to slow action against the climate crisis for decades is basically propaganda against people who take climate science seriously. I do need to make the concession that there is a sub-set of doomers (also on this sub) that could easily 'replace' deniers. Accelerationists, 'moral panic' doomers, or grifters who just like to score internet points (or sell books, crypto or gold) can probably effectively cause similar damage to some denier types.

Now, like you said, at 500 ppm CO2e, it's only realistic to see the future as an empty place. Clearly, hope isn't motivating people to change, and why do we deserve to hope if we're on track to go extinct and take everything else with us? If you're on a sinking boat that's also on fire, acting like everything is ok and doing nothing is the worst possible response. Hope should be the reward for putting out the fire and getting the sinking under control, not a default position we take to comfort ourselves in the flames. I will be very happy to hope for the future when there's a future to hope for. Hell, I'll even feel hopeful if our emissions level off, but so far that hasn't happened. There has been no change in the overall situation other than it getting worse. I refuse to entertain the delusion that things will get better because they've been good before and I'm tired of that being the expectation. Yesterday, it went from spring with no snow on the ground, to winter with snow on the ground in an hour. How many times can these deep freezes happen before life emerging from its protective cocoons is too vulnerable to survive? This is how we get spring fires and forests of suddenly dead trees. All I hear from everyone around here is \"I wish winter would go away\" and I can only respond with \"It did. It was spring. This is not normal, and neither was our winter\" which was warm until recently, when we started getting the deep cold we'd normally get in january. Life is not adapted to this! It can't be. In addition, I've seen this up close. It's hard to hope for a future when you've seen the edge. We're SOOOO unaware of the health of the world.

{"comment_text":"I guess the only reasonable counter argument is that acceptance might mean we abandon a technological solution. What I mean is some solution which brings back equilibrium without risking more dangerous effects (e.g. some sort of emissions capture on a scale greater than our industrial emissions production so there is a net reduction in GHG to preindustrial levels). I think acceptance of the facts actually supports finding a solution whereas denial or downplaying breeds complacency and hopium - if a valid solution does exist we may not be properly searching in the right place because we haven\u2019t really as a culture faced the fact that we have finished ourselves off but if it doesn\u2019t exist at all then it does matter really, what is done is done.

I am however a realist and know that we are screwed in several ways. However that does not mean that I am ready to give up on humanity. We do have some good points you know. Just \"giving up\" is selfish. There are still lots of little things we can do to delay the worst of what's to come. We have to do it together because the governments won't. First off is that you can change your diet somewhat, no you don't have to give up meat but go plant based 2 or 3 days a week. If you can, take public transit. If not, then figure out how to carpool or drive less during the week. Make 1 big trip and not several small trips. Walk or bike if you can. Plant a garden and make your yard into a \"food forest\" by planting native plants. Don't mow your yawn as much - hold off till after May if you can to help the pollinators recover. If you can go solar or buy your energy off of solar\/wind power \"green companies.\" Super insulate your home to cut up on your energy use. Learn to change your habits and before you know it your healthier, happier and enjoying life again. No, we are not going to \"save the humans\" from what's to come...but we can put it off for a little while longer.

{"comment_text":"Honestly the greenwashing that non carbon emitting generators get away with is indicative of the black and white thinking which dominates our public policy discussion and leads to poor outcomes. Energy\u2019s impact on the environment (as hidden through this map) is an n-dimensional hyperspace with differential effects based on location. - All non-local generation and storage requires land and distribution infrastructure that could otherwise be dedicated to something of more environmental or social value - Hydro floods valleys and destroys ecosystems (and in some cases homes). - Any generator that produces any sort of waste requires some sort of waste processing and management facility All in all the climate crisis is in front of mind right now. CO2 emissions are out of control and these generators aren\u2019t sustainable for however many billions of us there are. But the owners of distribution and generation assets have us exactly where they want us. Rather than people adding generation, storage, and passive electricity saving measures to their homes where the marginal cost to the environment is low we are talking about building nuclear plants again, flooding valleys, taking up huge amounts of land for vast solar farms, building giant wind farms through migration patterns. No solution is perfect and we need to aim for what works and what works quick but decarbonising our economy is going to be fatiguing and if we don\u2019t add up the opportunity-costs of the solutions quickly we are going to end up with a big tab to pay for the environment at the end.

{"comment_text":"1.) Illegal - Don't do it. 2.) Safety - Was the application the safest option within reason, and are those that are the end user aware of the risks, and accept those risks in an informed manner. You can't make anything 100% safe. You can make things \"safer\" though. Imagine making skydiving equipment. There's already a risk involved, with the activity you build in redundancies to negate a single, or even two failures. Even then it's not 100% safe and the end users accept the risks associated with the equipment. Compare that to the Ford Pinto where there was a risk but those end users were not made fully aware of it. Generally when an Engineer documents an in an email a safety concern most companies these days will hard stop any pushback on that. 3.) The Gray area. This is the area where something might not be illegal, but if it makes you like things are getting uncomfortably close to a line you need to say something, and get your statement in writing. 95% of the time I ran into Gray areas when dealing with sales people, who would use data dishonestly. \"Look we made rate for this 10 second window! We'll say that's the full 60 second rate and use that to publish our hourly rate!\" \"So your saying it might work for 6 months and then fail spectacularly. Well they only bought the 6 month warranty anyways... Yep it will work!\" \"We need you to tell the customer that this can't be done, so we can sell this really expensive solution instead.\" Other gray areas I've encountered are just skeezy things that managers do to pump up internal numbers. \"Hey there's an anonymous internal survey coming out, let's go over each answer as a group and discuss how 'they make you feel'.\" Fuck that. They are gauging how their team responds, so even if you don't participate they can narrow down your \"anonymous\" responses based on that if others participate. The other stuff I've seen are accepting small gifts from vendors, even if they are within corporate policy. I'd rather say I never accepted more than a cheap lunch than expose even the hint that there's something afoot. It also helps if you run into any of the other situations listed since generally you'll be seen as more honest and trustworthy with your statements.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"mmhfn0","post_title":"Where do you personally draw the line when it comes to ethics?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEngineers\/comments\/mmhfn0\/where_do_you_personally_draw_the_line_when_it\/","timestamp":1617847006.0,"char_len":2241,"word_len":397,"lang":"en"}

The only way you could come close to agency is by thinking in terms of some universal god head with humans being aspects of that (not to say that's my belief). Consciousness is a different concept, the ability to observe and experience - this is much more confusing \/ nuanced to me.

{"comment_text":"The answer depends on how you personally define free will, and what version of the universe you susbscribe to. In a single completely deterministic universe then the outcome can not be changed and nothing you can do can alter the outcome. That's what deterministic means. Therefore can you truly be considered to be free when you are essentially playing out a prewritten script? In a multiverse theory where all possible states of the universe exist, then every possible choice plays out and your concept of self or will is just a single possible state. In which how could you have been free to choose when all possible choices happened. From the compatibilists point of view, free will simply means free from external compulsion.

If you see a baby in a fire and choose to save it, you're still being motivated by something else, whether it be a nurturing instinct or pure good sammaritanism. If you choose to abandon it, you chose rationalize not saving it in that instance-- something motivated you to leave the baby. But! I do believe in fate. But fate is not as solid as many would assume. I think of it like string theory or butterfly theory-- there is a future that's destined for you, but one slight change can completely alter that.

{"comment_text":"No, Quatum computing has hardly even proved any commercial viability and is still purely experimental. AI has moved into the commercial arena more and more. The trajectory of automation is a tangible consideration. I don't think we are in a \"new age of technology\" Humanity is moving along the early portion of exponential growth of technology. I believe the \"intelligence explosion\" will happen by the end of the decade. Little things have happened like AI helped invent a better battery and mapped out all the possible proteins of the human body. Ai is also doing busy work, writing and producing images for people. What's going to bring us to a \"new age of technology\" is breakthroughs in consciousness and energy production. Post ufo disclosure will be a demarcation of a new age.

{"comment_text":"One of my favorite podcasters is Dan Carlin, a radio host turned political commenter, amateur historian, and amateur journalist. While he's best known for *Hardcore History*, which features many-hour-long, deep-dives on historical areas of great interest, he's also been hosting *Common Sense* for about 14 or 15 years now. Something he's said relatively recently on *Common Sense* that's really stuck with me is how terribly difficult it is to judge history when you're in it. Some of the greatest thinkers, political scientists, journalists, politicians, historians, and philosophers have tried to come up with larger themes or ideas about the era in which they lived, and the results are deeply inconsistent and unreliable. Even with the benefit of access to highly reliable information and nearly-objective analysis by experts, it's incredibly difficult to determine something about the history we're living, because we're missing the necessary ingredient of perspective. Time and distance grant perspective. Applied to your question specifically, we're looking at an emergent technology and social shift which already has made irrevocable marks across hundreds of cultures. Addictive social media which is purpose-built to gather data for the purpose of improving marketing, the immaculate presentation of a curated life for the judgment of others, the increasingly (deliberately) addictive nature of social media technology, algorithmic radicalization for of preferred content for increased engagement leading to radicalized perceptions of the world and beliefs... also unprecedented connectivity, the creation of an entirely different kind of community, great geographical distances between loved ones melting away instantly... ***it's huge***. We're not in a position to say, in aggregate, if social media is more harm or more good, and we probably won't be in a place to realistically reach a judgment for decades. I wouldn't trust even people who are emergent experts on social media to make that kind of grand determination. It's too soon to tell.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"ck232h","post_title":"Has social media done more harm or good to society?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueAskReddit\/comments\/ck232h\/has_social_media_done_more_harm_or_good_to_society\/","timestamp":1564540024.0,"char_len":2067,"word_len":309,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I've recently unfollowed every one of my friends on Facebook so that I could have a blank news feed. No ads, no promoted posts, no shitty memes. A literal blank feed. Just a place to post my photos, message my friends, and organize events. I did a similar thing with instagram- when I made an account I put a hard limit on only following 30 people in my social circle, and unfollowing anybody who posted memes, news stories, activism, politics, or *anything* that wasn't just a photo of what they were up to that day. My social media use has been reduced to seeing two or three posts from friends, each day, getting event invites, and messaging the members of my band. It's very similar to what Facebook was 10 years ago when it first rolled out, and I absolutely *love* it. By excising out all of the negative aspects of social media usage, I've started to see it in a *much* more positive light. Because of it, I'm still friends with people from grade school. I have a thriving group of best friends as I approach my 30s- something that, I've heard, is very difficult to do. So, I guess my answer would be that social media, as a *concept* is a net positive for society. It keeps my relationships close and builds a strong social network for me. The negative aspects of social media are a product of the providers themselves- they've gameified the platform to encourage narcissism, anger, and reductionist thinking, and they've done it by placing addictive psychological hooks on receiving \"likes\", shares, and followers. I truly think there's a strong market demand right now for a pure social media experience. One that doesn't curate your news feed for you. One that doesn't let you send clickbait headlines out into your news feed. One that doesn't let you measure your likes or followers. Photos, status updates, events, and a messenger. No links. No likes. Invisible follower counts. No celebrities, corporations, meme pages, or public profiles. I think it would be a hit. It's part of why Snapchat got so big. People are tired of the BS. But then snapchat sold out, and it's now a dying platform.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"ck232h","post_title":"Has social media done more harm or good to society?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueAskReddit\/comments\/ck232h\/has_social_media_done_more_harm_or_good_to_society\/","timestamp":1564540024.0,"char_len":2122,"word_len":371,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Good question. I think it has its pros and cons. It does put you in contact with a lot of people you wouldn't otherwise be in contact with but in a rather impersonal way. If it wasn't for Facebook, I probably wouldn't often see pictures of my nieces because they live interstate and I don't often get to see my family. Also, if you're part of a social group of some sort people in the group will often use Facebook to communicate with each other. And it can be a good way to find out about community events and organising more personal events (involving friends or family). But yes, it also has its downsides. Now if someone goes on a holiday (vacation) they are often expected to share photos on social media. Meaning that they are often thinking about that instead of just being in the moment. And people often share a lot of crap on Facebook that I never needed to know about it (admittedly I've been guilty of this sometimes too).","platform":"reddit","post_id":"ck232h","post_title":"Has social media done more harm or good to society?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueAskReddit\/comments\/ck232h\/has_social_media_done_more_harm_or_good_to_society\/","timestamp":1564540024.0,"char_len":936,"word_len":173,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Social media has just highlighted the opinions of others that were already there. People have already had majority of the opinions they post online and take very little corrosion to convince them to say something they already had in the back of their mind. You can see the very clear differences of opinions based on where a person lives because it's molded by environment. The large amount of land in the U.S., specifically, causes the culture to diversify and have radically different influence and opinion. If you're an avid traveler you can see the distinct difference of culture even from one coast to the other whereas with smaller countries the ideologies are generally more cohesive due to lack of excessive space. Historically many states that were originally slave states that have large rural populations tend to have a larger amount of the population to continue to see cultural diversity, for example, as a bad thing because the lack of new people\/ideas in the area as well as the opposite for none slave states that generally have a lot of large cities. In a way, social media has been generally more positive because it has allowed the exposure of different opinions instead of them continuing to be segregated from each other.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"ck232h","post_title":"Has social media done more harm or good to society?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueAskReddit\/comments\/ck232h\/has_social_media_done_more_harm_or_good_to_society\/","timestamp":1564540024.0,"char_len":1244,"word_len":210,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Depends on what you call \"social media\". The earliest example I can think of is usenet (newsgroups) - which was a sort of universal discussion forum, fairly anonymous, and like Reddit, divided along topics, sometimes very very specific (most famously including: alt.die.die.die.wesley.crusher, etc.) These groups mostly thrived with good moderation, or became shitshows with lousy moderation. Since moderation was purely unpaid volunteer work, most of these groups eventually disintegrated into chaos. I'm not aware that this entire Internet facility is still functioning at all, anywhere. But in the late 1980's to early 1990's, it was basically THE internet, outside of Compuserve and AOL. I'm pretty sure that this is where the term \"alt.right\" originally came from. But at the end of the day - the phenomenon you're talking about can be easily summed up in a well-known diatribe titled: \"The Tragedy of the Commons\". The end.

{"comment_text":"Social Media is merely a tool. The question is better phrased as whether or not humanity has used it to greater benefit or harm. My answer would have to be that the usage of it has moments of brilliance, moments of horror, and overall a big, fat stretch of indifferent impact. While the notion of communication has changed to be about clever bits and witty pictures with a few words of dubious origin, it merely marks a change in the colloquial communication of ideas and culture that is better served as a hodgepodge of positives and negatives that seem to even out. I will say that the tool is potentially most vile in the hands of those who profit from it in some fashion, as algorithms can be used to bend information to favor certain ideas over others and we have seen it serve as a fantastic tool for fostering division between people with otherwise common struggles of day-to-day life. However, the ability to communicate with friends, contemporaries, and loved ones in an instant is... still incredible to me.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"ck232h","post_title":"Has social media done more harm or good to society?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueAskReddit\/comments\/ck232h\/has_social_media_done_more_harm_or_good_to_society\/","timestamp":1564540024.0,"char_len":1020,"word_len":179,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Definitely more harm. If you watch The Great Hack on Netflix, it explains everything about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Social media contains a bunch of highly personal information on people on a population-wide basis that\u2019s easily taken advantage of. If fact, the access to this data is monetised. Dangerously this goes beyond creepy retail marketing, this data is being used for psy-ops (psychological operations) for political\/ideological purposes too. Cambridge Analytica (CA) was a defence contractor (trading under SQL defence) that created propaganda content for organisations like NATO, the British military, and US military before it got involved in election campaigns. - The CEO of CA has personal ties to Steve Bannon and Nigel Farage, and that\u2019s how it ended up working for the Brexit referendum and Trump campaigns. - The m.o. was to create a simple & inconspicuous \u2018personality quiz\u2019 on Facebook with the caveat buried deep in the usage agreement that allowed CA to collect personal information from the participants profile as well as the profiles of all the participants\u2019s friends. - CA ended up with ~100k participants and collected information from 87m profiles, then using data analysis (such as artificial intelligence & machine learning) they developed a model that classified personalities by ~5000 traits. - Next, while focusing only \u2018the persuadables\u2019 in swing states, CA used these 5k data points to profile & deliver highly targeted propaganda (such as video ads) to each voter on individual level. - Facebook willingly facilitated this unethical data collection for \u2018research\u2019 purposes without any due diligence to ensure the data was handled correctly or actuall for research, furthermore CA continued using the data after Facebook had requested CA delete it. - As a result of all of this, the Trump campaign produced 5.9 million campaign videos compared 66 thousand produced by the Hillary campaign. This kind of populational data is export restricted in the U.K. as it can be used for psychological warfare. Cambridge Analytica was involved with Leave.EU in the Brexit referendum but refused to discuss the Brexit campaign with documentary producers likely for legal reasons since the company is registered in the U.K. **In the end of the day: none of the data was even hacked, everything collected & distributed through willing participation in the standard channels.

But they were disconnected. Each standing alone yelling their delusions. Now we have 10 000 communication each with the same 10 000 crazies in them, supporting their craziness. It creates a sense of justification through numbers. How can 10 000 people believe the same thing if there's nothing there, right? On top of that, almost all forums are self policed with moderators who condemn any dissent. Turning them all into echo chambers pumping out propaganda without any checks or balances. This is why we have conflict such as the stupidest person most people on earth could name is polling as the first choice for people to male their major decisions for them. It's why people are as stupid as they are these days. Look at Trump, Taylor Greene, Giuliani, Q, etc... these people are diagnostic anomalies in human intelligence. They're so low they should realistically be rejected from analysis to being outliers below the mean. Yet... people are listening to then simply because OTHERS seem to be listening to them. A demonic cabal of immortal vampire pedophiles sounds like what it is one on one. So stupid that any response lowers your own worth below acceptable levels.

The economy took a dip and a few years to recover and jobs were lost but life went on for most. What most people saw was their retirement take a momentary hit. People lost jobs and homes which over the next decade resulted in an a huge rubber banding recovery. I\u2019ll leave it to the policy and economic wonks to fight about how which efforts affected all of that. Just that for the vast majority of Americans the day to day effects were pretty minimal which is why the Occupy movements didn\u2019t really get widespread support. All of this is cyclical, we just have really bad collective memory fed by media which lets wolves back into the henhouse again and again.

{"comment_text":"We had recently bought a house with a higher monthly payment (a fixer-upper at that). We both worked at the same company that hit a major sales decline, which the company responded to by cutting salaries for salaried employees and hours for production workers. We very much supported the pay cuts, because that was chosen as an alternative to laying people off. We all made less money but nobody lost their job. The salary cuts were progressive, meaning the higher-paid employees suffered deeper cuts. My wife and I just barely made enough to be in the middle tier, which was a 13% cut. Which meant we had to tighten our belts financially, and we were no longer able to put any money into fixing up the house. We were 13% down for two years, then the pay came back in increments, so it was five years before we made the same money again - five years right in the middle of the time period where people our age generally make the most gains as they progress professionally. So that wasn't just five years of lost wages, that was five years of missing out on significant raises. We didn't complain because a lot of people had it much worse. And although the pay cut hurt, we felt proud to work for a company that worked so hard to avoid cutting people loose. At the time, the biggest pain in the ass was living in an unfinished house for years. In retrospect, though, the biggest impact was that we postponed starting a family for quite a few years. By the time we had things sorted out enough that we felt comfortable having a kid, we were pretty old for it. Again, we were SUPER LUCKY because a hell of a lot of people who try to start a family at that age have to deal with fertility challenges, and the painful and expensive treatments to address them. And feelings of inadequacy and regret. Whereas when we finally started trying, my wife immediately got pregnant. I mean *immediately*. So we were spared that. However, by the time we would have been thinking about having a second child, we were old enough that it didn't seem like a good idea. We're already well older than the parents of any of our son's peers. We'd be older still for the hypothetical second kid. And my wife was now in the age range where the chances of genetic defects starts rising [exponentially with each passing year](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Risk-of-Down-Syndrome-and-all-chromosomal-abnormalities-by-maternal-age_fig1_351225040).

{"comment_text":"Married with three kids in school. It was an absolute grind. My revenue dropped 70% from 2007 to 2008. My wife's company laid off half its staff, leaving my wife to work some pretty grueling hours. Meanwhile, I was turning over rocks and looking for any income. We had moved into a house two years earlier. The mortgage loan officer said, \"You guys have excellent credit and income. Why are you buying a house this inexpensive? You could afford a house three times this much?\" Well, the reason was that we had already seen the warning signs flashing in 2006 that the economy was in a fragile state. So we bought a house based on what we could afford on one salary and banked our money. That's the thing. If you're in your twenties reading this, remember that anything could disrupt the economy at any time. A war. A government policy. A pandemic. You name it. Which means it's so important to steadily work towards an emergency fund to cover three to six months of living expenses. This is when someone will inevitably say, \"Well, I'm barely getting by.\" Well, you're not exceptional. My first job out of college paid below the poverty line, yet I managed to save money. Even if it was $50 a month, I figured out a way. I worked a second job. I picked up gig work. Whatever I needed to shove the money into a savings account and not touch it. I promise I'm not trying to be one of those tedious boomer types who opine that your daily trip to Starbucks will bankrupt you. All I'm saying is that it's really easy to succumb to the financial death of a thousand cuts, the $10 monthly subscription you never use, the daily trip to the lunch counter, you name it. Yet all that shit adds up, one bit at a time. If you sat down and really added it up, you'd be shocked at how much cash flows through your fingers without even realizing it. Here's a useful exercise. The next time you purchase something, double the price in your head. That's what it really costs in after-tax income. Suddenly, that $5.00 Quarter Pounder with cheese is $10. Still want to make that purchase? So what I'm saying here isn't to cut out the Starbucks, but rather to exercise awareness of your finances and always prioritize saving money. Also, make it a priority to understand interest rates and what a mere percentage difference could save you. Be ruthless when it comes to insurance. Or the difference between buying groceries across town versus the convenient grocery down the street. Become financially savvy in all your decisions. Doing so saved our bacon in 2008. And it's just as important to do so today. Because you never know what fucking curve ball the economy will throw your way.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskAnAmerican\/comments\/1dny150\/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after\/","timestamp":1719291758.0,"char_len":2680,"word_len":481,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"My family was fortunate to make it out, but with my father working for Ford and myself a college intern with a supplier we were more affected by the auto collapse than the housing collapse. My dad had a nerve wracking experience as coworker after coworker was escorted out of the building over a week, never knowing if they'd call him next. At my own work we lost young engineers. All the interns at our school with a gig at GM found themselves out when they got back to school. One of the hardest things to see were grown men in their 50s just break down at their desks. They'd done everything they were supposed to- go to college, get a good job, work hard, have a family, etc- and it was all collapsing around them. I graduated a year later. Finding a job- any job, even flipping burgers- was hard. I felt really bad for a friend who was a teacher. He graduated a few years earlier, subbed to get experience while living with his parents, then finally got a full-time gig across the country. He moved, taught for one year, and was let go as the district got hit with budget cuts because of the housing collapse. He went straight back to living with his parents, spending the summer of 2010 churning out applications while getting into arguments about why he was unemployed. He eventually got a full time gig a few years later but the process embittered him. The long term impact, I think, was that it took a long time for folks my age (millennials) to get started on life. If you can barely get a part time job, you're not going to be moving out of your parent's house, buying your own place, starting a family, etc, as soon as possible- moreso if you got student loan debt on top of it.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskAnAmerican\/comments\/1dny150\/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after\/","timestamp":1719291758.0,"char_len":1695,"word_len":317,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I had recently gotten out of school; I lived in NYC and worked for a nonprofit organization. The economic crisis hit us immediately like a ton of bricks. Within days after Lehman and AIG collapsed, we got letters from two major foundations saying they could no longer fulfill the six-figure grants they had awarded us months earlier. One of these foundations, coincidentally, was almost entirely invested in (and may have been related to) AIG. It was a huge foundation, and if I'm not mistaken, it ceased to exist soon. As the days went on, numerous major donors contacted us to say they had to pause all their giving, and we knew that for every person who called there were 10 more who just weren't going to write us a check. Within one week, I came in to the office and my boss grabbed me, pulled me into a conference room, and started by saying \"I just need you to know that your job is safe for now....\" but we were laying off about 1\/5 of our staff. A few weeks later we laid off another 1\/5. Several of our peer organizations folded within a month or two, realizing the cliffs they were facing. I was so down about what happened to NYC that I started actively looking for jobs elsewhere. By the following March I was offered a job in Oregon, and I took it almost without hesitating. This turned out to be one of the best decision I ever made! In Oregon the crisis was obviously still an issue but it was so, so, so much less \"in your face\" than in NYC. So in the end, while it was stressful and upsetting, I was fine. I didn't lose my job, I was like 25 so I didn't have any serious investments to worry about, and the crisis directly led to me moving to a place I love and still live.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskAnAmerican\/comments\/1dny150\/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after\/","timestamp":1719291758.0,"char_len":1698,"word_len":322,"lang":"en"}

In '09, though, I'd send out 1-2 dozen applications a day and it took around 8 months for my first in-person interview, which I didn't get, and another 3 months after that before I got a job paying about half what the lowest-paid average for the career would have been, and I got stuck in that job for almost a decade, constantly losing progress on career advancement because there was no \"up\" at that job NOR was I gaining any quality experience to help my advancement. The only way I got out of that job was to quit and spin-up my side business (which was, at best, \"beer money\") into full-time job.

{"comment_text":"So I was born in 1984 and in Riverside, CA. A place that was hit incredibly hard by the housing bubble and then absolutely wrecked by the Global Financial Crises. I honestly feel that between the two our economy has never really been the same. The events and general mood before the crash needs to be stated first. People were convinced that home prices are going to go up every year, constantly. A home might have been worth $140,000 in 1998 and by 2005\/2006 it was worth over $500,000 (which adjusting for inflation would be nearly $800k today. This idea that home values doubled or tripled was something people expected. Spending was high. People were commonly taking loans on homes they already owned to buy fancy cars. Buying a home for $500k when just a few years prior was worth under $200k was not seen as risky. It was seen as buying a $500k home that by the early 2010s will be a million dollar home. Even if you can't afford it, you can still sell it and make hundreds of thousands of dollars. A lot of things during the bubble year didn't feel real. I knew someone who was in his early 20s, he inherited a home with a multi six figure loan on it (more than $400k) and the bank was ok with this transfer of the loan even though he never had a real job to prove his income. I saw people buy homes that were absurdly expensive while they were barely working. We were building a lot of housing in town, but it was nearly all suburban tract home McMansions. Very little of it was urban style living. A little bit by the university, a little bit in downtown. But it was super minimal. People were largely drunk with cheap access to debt. Those big raised trucks with $10,000 lift kits on them were super popular. Big SUVs were popular, it was very common to see vehicles with rear seat TVs, far more common than it is today, I guess this is also because people are on their phones more. The well paying jobs that young men wanted was working in construction, and for women it was being a real estate agent. Everyone wanted to work in real estate. It was a common experience to run into someone you haven't seen in a while and then they tell you they are becoming a real estate agent. It was a grift economy, and people were making a lot of money from grifting or servicing grifters. When the global financial crises happened.. Several sectors of the local economy all went to shit. New home building stopped immediately. All those young men who were employed in the sectors stopped finding work. Immediately. We had an absurdly high unemployment rate among young men. All those real estate agents. Most of them lost their job as well. Many firms and agencies that had to cut back their employees did so with the whole \"Last in, first out\" mentality, so it was very common for a lot of young people who were getting started in their career to be shown the door. New car sales took a hit. A lot of people could not pay the note on their big trucks and other stupid flashy cars, those disappeared. Local wages plummeted. Jobs that were paying $15 per hour in the late 90s and early 2000s were paying $8 per hour in 2010. We went from like 5-6% umemployment in 2006 to 14% unemployment by 2009. The unemployment rate stuck around for years. People were commonly losing their homes. I remember taking bike rides in the neighborhood and seeing homes with everything inside the home brought out and sitting on the front lawn. The people who weathered the storm the best were people who owned a home free and clear, no mortgage. Nothing flashy. Just good ole rock stability. Job loss.. they can get through it. As i mentioned, home construction stopped. Many of these homes were places that were not finished. It was common to hear about people breaking into the homes and stealing all the copper wire. This whole \"If you work a trade you will never be unemployed\". It was total bullshit. These were among the people who got hit the hardest. Unemployed plumber was common. I knew a surveyor who I grew up with and he lived around the corner, he told me that in 2006, as a 22 year old kid, he was making $120,000. Before the crash in 2007 he made $80,000 and thought he was going to surpass 2006. By 2008 he said he would go weeks without being called, and barely made $20,000. I don't think his business rebounded until the mid 2010s. What I did see was people with money buying homes with the intention of fixing them up and flipping them. They had the mentality that this drop in prices was brief, very brief. A lot of them though prices would completely recover by 2010 or 2011. So the mentality was, buy homes, and then completely fix them up. Maybe pay $200k for the home, $50,000 for fixing it up, and in a few years when the economy is back, sell it for $700,000. Profit $450,000. I knew several people who were doing this. The thing is, the housing economy didn't come back in 2011. Or 2012. Or 2013. Even by 2019, 10 years after they bought it, the home was not worth $700k. But what did they do in the mean time. They rented the homes out. Do understand. While some effects were immediate in 2007 and 2008. Many long term effects still persisted well into the early 2010s. I would say 2011 and 2012 were still rough recession years and by that point it had been going on for five years.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dny150","post_title":"What was it (personally) like immediately after 2008 financial crisis?","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskAnAmerican\/comments\/1dny150\/what_was_it_personally_like_immediately_after\/","timestamp":1719291758.0,"char_len":5401,"word_len":980,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"My story is a bit interesting....in 2006 I bought my house for 102k...Then in 2009 my then wife went back to gambling, and scamming. Part of this meant she was not making the house payments, and was communicating with the bank, to keep me from knowing this. However, due to the sudden rise of foreclosures...the last thing the bank wanted was for us to move out.(Wells Fargo) So, we ended up doing a modification, which is basically new terms to your loan. Due to late payments, interest, etc.. In 2010, when we actually signed the modification..we now owed 110k on the same house, we had previously owed 96k on at the time of purchase. One benefit of the modification, was PMI was not part of the new loan, which was at 5% approximately. Payment was just under 1k a month, so, this was still a cheaper option, than moving, cause homes in the neighborhood were selling for as low as 70k.

{"comment_text":">When media is privately owned, it tends to become concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations or individuals. Which, counterintuitively, is not an issue. Those few corporations will cater to different types of people and you will have a platform for any major viewpoint, as dismissing a viewpoint will mean you are not getting money from those who hold it. Only topics that are omitted are fringe opinions that are scaring off the advertisers - but for those there are many different media channels that you can express them - many of which you are able to host yourself. If media would be state-controlled the issue of concentration of power would be an actual issue as there will be no media that is outside of power of a single entity. >Private media companies operate on a for-profit basis. This means their primary goal is to generate revenue, often prioritising sensationalism and entertainment over in-depth, unbiased reporting. The pursuit of profit can lead to a focus on clickbait, divisive content, and the sidelining of important issues that do not attract immediate attention or advertising dollars. For-profit basis is actually good for the media, as it will mean that most opinions would have media to use - because every viewpoint that has multiple people supporting it will be a market to tap into. You can see that in current media state, as even fringe views get their media outlets. If media would be state controlled, it could have better quality - as I agree that for-profit media does emphasize sensationalist and loves divisive concepts. But what good is the quality if a single entity has the sole decisionmaking of what warrants media attention? >Media owners can use their platforms to advance their political agendas (or the agenda of their donors), subtly or overtly influencing public perception and electoral outcomes. Which is not a major issue in a landscape of multiple media outlets - those who are popular, are popular because people agree with their viewpoint in general. This means that while they have influence over politics, this influence generally needs to be in line with expectations of the audience - or they risk losing the audience. In state-controlled media there is nothing like that - media will serve the majority because it is controlled by gov't chosen by majority. >To clarify, I am not arguing that the media should be state-controlled; I am just arguing that media ownership and the bias it produces fundamentally flaws our current democracy. Your view as stated is \"Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned\" which is in itself wrong (as democratic countries do exist alongside private media). Paired with what you said here it's clear that your view is more akin to \"Private media creates flaws in democracy\". But for that view to be true you would need to have an alternative which does not create flaws in democracy. And as I shown on examples before - the other option of state-controilled media is not \"creating flaws\", it's directly going against democratic values by limiting the power and control over access to media. So are those flaws you describe flaws of private media, or flaws of democracy? Because any of your examples have a similar part in other avenues of private ownership. Power inherently concentrates in hands of individuals with more resources - whether those resources are money, knowledge or charisma. This is an inherent flaw of democracy, not an issue with private media. Private media prioritizes sensationalism and divisive topics because it is what people want - this means that it's a result of democratic choice made by people deciding what to watch. Private media exerts political influence, but does it only because they have people watching them - which again is a result of a choice. There is no flawless system - democracy has its flaws and we still use it because it's the best option we have. Same with private media - they have their flaws, but we use it because it's the best option that we have. Unless you have any option that can be implemented and be better - your view is just an empty truism.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":4157,"word_len":701,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"1. Rather than saying that centralization is a natural result of private ownership, I would argue that corporations often benefit from favorable government regulations or other unfair conditions that do not stem from private ownership. For example, the idea of large national news networks really came about during a time when television was so new that the networks themselves exerted high level of influence over TV distribution. Making it a utility might help ensure that other stations can broadcast content, though it might also entrench the companies that manage the cables depending on how one goes about it. 2. Sensationalized news is an issue, but again I think it's a symptom of something else. If anything I would say it's a natural consequence of the rise of social media, which is literally addictive in the way it manipulates your brain's reward system. Private ownership and profit aren't the underlying cause, which I would link to technological over dependence. 3. This is really only an issue if the outlet isn't honest about their biases. Political views will always shape the news and the idea of truly unbiased news is a fantasy. The best you can typically hope for is a biased source that allows opposing viewpoints fair time. Very little about your criticisms actually explains how private ownership causes these issues. Centralization and sensationalism can both be attributed to the tendency to try and garner attention, and bias is unavoidable. And public ownership, the only alternative, is infinitely worse. Furthermore, compared to say 50 years ago or so, there are far more news sources today, including many smaller outlets or local news distributors. If anything, news is more decentralized than ever before, it's just that the large networks are trying to seem bigger to avoid becoming irrelevant. Many large news outlets are losing viewers rapidly, with smaller internet shows sometimes outperforming them with ease.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":1957,"word_len":313,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Your concerns about the effects of privately owned media on democracy highlight several critical issues, but there are nuances to consider that may challenge the view that democracy cannot exist with privately owned media. Diversity of Sources and Pluralism: The rise of the internet and digital platforms has dramatically increased the number and variety of media outlets. While large corporations do own many major media outlets, the internet has enabled a proliferation of alternative and independent media sources. These can provide diverse perspectives and counterbalance the biases of mainstream media. This diversity can help to inform the public more fully and support democratic processes by offering a wider range of viewpoints. Regulatory Frameworks: Many democracies have established regulatory frameworks designed to preserve media pluralism and limit the concentration of media ownership. For example, rules against cross-ownership of television, radio, and print media in the same market can prevent too much power from being concentrated in the hands of a few. Moreover, transparency requirements can help mitigate the influence of hidden agendas. Such regulations aim to ensure that the media landscape supports a healthy democracy by promoting diversity and minimizing undue influence. Media Literacy and Public Engagement: Enhancing media literacy among the public is crucial. By educating people on how to critically evaluate sources and recognize bias, individuals can make more informed decisions despite the potential biases of privately owned media. Encouraging critical thinking and scrutiny is a vital component of maintaining a democratic society, especially in an era of information overload. Economic Viability and Quality Journalism: The economic models of media do influence content, but this does not inherently preclude democratic values. Many privately owned media outlets strive to maintain high journalistic standards because credibility attracts a loyal audience. Moreover, non-profit journalism and publicly funded but independently operated media organizations can provide high-quality, unbiased reporting without the pressures of profit motives. In summary, while the concentration of media ownership and its pursuit of profit present challenges to democracy, these issues do not make democracy untenable. Through regulatory oversight, the promotion of media literacy, and the support of a pluralistic media environment, democracies can still thrive even with privately owned media. The key is ensuring that the systems in place robustly support transparency, accountability, and diversity in media ownership and content.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":2666,"word_len":380,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"For starts we don't live in a democracy. We live in a Republic. But I digress. You fix most of the problems that you claim to have with a truth in news law. If a news outlet wants to call themselves news then they must be able to back their stories with fact. If they can't they can be sued. It would result in incredibly boring news because they would all report straight facts. And there would probably be dozens of shows that comprise what we call news today that are not considered news. But ultimately you are missing one thing.... It is on the individual to decided what they take as news and because it is the problem with a democracy is not the new bias but the people too lazy to find out more.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":705,"word_len":136,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I'm not so sure i would agree about the trend of concentration of power. Certainly there is some concentration of power happening right now and over the last 20 years or so. I know for example Sinclair owns a large number of local news stations and influenced content on those stations. That is a concentration of power. but * we have had private media in this country for 250 years. Has there been a stead trend towards concentration for that whole period or are the last 20 years unusual? I don't know the answer * While concentration is happening. Decentralization is also happening. two clear examples of that are (1) this conversation which is only loosely moderated in terms of content and (2) the Joe Rogan podcast. Its obviously that some concentration of power is happening, but my nearly 70 year old dad gets his news from various content creators on you tube. Fox news is no longer his main source for new, they are just another content creator on you tube. Its unclear to me which of these is winning, the concentration of the decentralization. I don't consume any media from the traditional\/concentrated outlets. Profit motives play a factor, but they are not the only factor. Warren Buffet frequently advocates for higher taxes on himself. Bill Gates is giving away money. Elon musk bought twitter because... idk why, but it seems not because of profit motives. Why did he start an electric car company, surely there were easier ways to make money? If you look at yourself personally, i bet you care about getting and keeping a job with a high salary, but I bet that is not the only thing you care about.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":1638,"word_len":285,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"TLDR: the problems would persist with or without privatized media. Your claim is about the definition of a true democracy, which differs depending on who you ask. Either way, like all forms of governance, I understand it as a spectrum, which contains all ideologies, and only theoretically could it be realized in \u2018true\u2019 or absolute terms. In other words, the democracy you speak of, prevents itself from existing, even without privatized media. Social forums have shown to be equally if not more misleading regarding partisanship, and misinformation. You still have public and private industries that propel war, pollution, job loss, housing costs etc. corruption is baked into society, and our disinterest in accurately identifying that corruption will persist regardless of ownership. I agree with your sentiment, though it could be argued that the solution more within reach is actually more privatization so that there is a healthy balance within the media ecosystem. My issue with that view is that, privatized media will prioritize itself over the people, as per capitalism. If that means deceiving the public, they will do it. So that raises another question, would media be less or more corrupt were it publicly owned?","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":1240,"word_len":196,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"A perfectly unbiased media outlet is not feasible. The owner of any outlet has the incentive to push the agenda that they support. This is true of both state owned and private outlets. The third option would be a publicly owned media outlet, but there is no feasible way of having a publicly owned outlet that perfectly reports on what everyone is interested in. By your view, democracy is incomparable with all types of media. The existence of cynicism poisons any type of media. The way to navigate around this as a person who is attempting to be objective is to read multiple sources with competing interests. Read news from privately held outlets with different political views and read state-run media news. When reading any outlet, try to consider how this might advance the agenda of whoever runs it. Stop reading outlets when you notice that they are unable to do objective reporting on the stories they report on.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":922,"word_len":159,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"\"When media is privately owned, it tends to become concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations or individuals.\" Control of mass media will always be concentrated some way or another. This is because media production and dissemination requires large pieces of physical capital. Newspapers require printing presses. Television requires studios and cameras. Internet outlets require servers and cables. None of this is going to happen in someone's basement, and none of that touches on distribution - newspapers need trucks, broadcast requires licenses and antennas, online requires AWS spend and SREs. These things can only be provisioned by large organizations. The primary types of large organizations we have are corporations and the state, so you really only get to choose between different mixes of those two.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dou01z","post_title":"CMV: Democracy cannot exist in a world where media is privately owned","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/changemyview\/comments\/1dou01z\/cmv_democracy_cannot_exist_in_a_world_where_media\/","timestamp":1719392338.0,"char_len":823,"word_len":127,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I mean government owned media runs the risk of propaganda, censorship, collusion with the government... Thats probably a bigger risk than privately owned media. Just ask anyone from a country with government media. Ideally, i think you have a government network... Even if it is propaganda but u also have private media. This way information has a chance of coming out. As to the profit motive... I find people often just separate things into government run or corporate.there are just so many other forms. For example, japan has private hospitals, but they have laws like it must be non-profit and i think run by a doctor. I would have little issue with a law saying news must be non profit. Again...

The actual problem here is media monopolies, lack of regulation and as a result lack of quality alternatives. As you say a solely government owned media isn't a good option either so wouldn't the ideal be just a more scattered media landscape with a wide range of ownership structures including a public alternative?

Clearly this doesn't make sense, because our congresspeople are there to represent us. If they don't know us, and our problems, they can't represent us.

{"comment_text":"American government has its fingers in a ton of pots. It regulates the financial world, it invests in technology, it gives agricultural subsidies--it makes a *ton* of decisions in an immense number of specialized fields. The people at the helm--elected politicians--can't possibly be expected to be experts in all these fields at once. That'd be ridiculous. They're also busy people. Lobbying, essentially, is an expert (or a representative of an expert, such as a lobbyist for Boeing) trying to explain to politicians why they should vote a certain way. They pay them because it wouldn't make financial sense for a politician to spend time listening to expert testimony when he could be fundraising. That's it; a corporation pays a politician for the privilege to explain their side of the story. Now, of course, shady lobbying happens. But it's not bribery in and of itself.

{"comment_text":">Congress shall make no law [...] prohibiting [...] the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. - First Amendment of the Constitution That is the core of lobbying. What you are describing is not lobbying, you're describing what 99% of Americans *think* lobbying is. Lobbying is petitioning the government, and that can be done with or without money. When Wikipedia went dark to protest SOPA, that was lobbying. There isn't a single thing in life that isn't made easier with money, so is your solution to repeal this part of the First Amendment? From a practical standpoint what are you proposing? One of the most successful lobbying groups in US history was the Anti-Saloon League. They did not have money. They were going up against the 5th largest industry in the United States. They did not even have majority support for prohibition at any point prior to its passage. Yet they were powerful because money doesn't buy power. If money bought power Tobacco wouldn't have so many restrictions, Prohibition would never have happened, and there never would have been anti-trust legislation. What holds power is votes. Legislators value one thing above all: their job. Money is one way to help them keep it, but it is a very *very* indirect way to get votes. A pair of 3 million dollar congressional campaigns could easily end up fighting over essentially just 20,000 swing voters. And considering lobbyists, corporations and unions can not donate money *at all* and that PACs can donate at maximum $5,000\/election cycle money is in fact a very indirect way of getting influence. Take the NRA for example. Their bank account is actually not that impressive, however they have a mailing list of millions of active voters. A bad grade is enough to cost someone re-election. The NRA has proven this in election after election, when they target someone for defeat they often lose. Bloomberg's group *Mayors Against Illegal Guns* have been badly outspending the NRA all year, but the NRA still won this last go-round. If the victory was simply to the group with the most money we would have passed gun reform. So how can Average Joe American be heard? Get involved. Seriously, it's no more complicated than that. Call your congressperson, you'd be surprised how few they get. Volunteer on a campaign of someone you feel passionately about. If there's a single issue that sticks out, form a group. Broaden it with as many local voters as you can and try to flex your muscle. Yes this requires a commitment of time, and so there will always be some unable to participate, but why should that make the system immoral? Should no one be allowed to participate so long as there are some who are too busy to do so?","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1gquzj","post_title":"I don't believe lobbying is ethically or morally right.

{"comment_text":"I like this position. Now you just need to make it into a law. We just need to go talk to a legislator about it and... that's actually lobbying. So it's clear that at least *some* lobbying is sensible. I might propose that you don't like *unethical* lobbying - lobbying when there's a clear conflict of interest between a for-profit interest and the common good. And it's clear that we have insufficient restrictions on such unethical lobbying. You may also dislike the side effect of lobbying that it 'raises the bar' to be heard - the more money is spent on competing for our legislators' time and energy, the more money you need to get some of our legislators' time and energy. Economics in action. I would argue that that's not a problem with lobbying in and of itself, but with *relative wealth inequality*. Lobbying and many other activities, some of which under normal circumstances promote a healthy democracy, can convert wealth into political influence, and so such activities allow the wealthy disproportionate, unjust levels of political influence compared to everyone else. But without such activities, the wealthy still have disproportionate influence, and just have to exercise it illegally (and can). Without the wealthy, meanwhile, you can expect the price of lobbying to be lower because rich people aren't competing with each other for legislator time, crowding you and me out. So to summarize: * Lobbying by for-profit interests (directly or indirectly) is pretty clearly unethical, a kind of conflict of interest that should be heavily regulated or outright forbidden. * Relative wealth inequalities in a society screw up lobbying by raising the 'market price' for a legislator's time beyond the reach of the average person. * Despite those two things, lobbying itself is a pretty important part of the political process, because the people need a way to convey their interests to their representatives.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1gquzj","post_title":"I don't believe lobbying is ethically or morally right.

{"comment_text":"I wrote a dissertation on the Food Industry and its influence on lobbying. The biggest issue in American politics is its incredible dependence on money - for election campaigns, in decision-making, and the like. As many posters here said, lobbying in itself is not immoral - it is a way of providing expertise on many subjects congressmen know nothing about, to raise pertinent issues, and the like. The problem stems from the fact that the lobby groups with the economically powerful corporations that back them, and thus the most capital, are more likely to be heard, as they'll hire former congressmen and other influential individuals with contacts, and have the economic capital to back it up. The problem then becomes that the only issues debated in congress are those presented by powerful corporations - say the beef lobbyists pitted against the corn lobbyists, and congress' views of the issues are narrowed to those talking points. Money talks, and the people, including activist groups, do not have much money, and are thus relatively powerless. They have a perceived access, but as they cannot afford lobbyists with influence, nor present views from powerful corporations, they become sidelined.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1gquzj","post_title":"I don't believe lobbying is ethically or morally right.

{"comment_text":"Lobbying is a double-edged sword and I'll explain it after this: To be exceedingly simple, there are two kinds of spending-related legislation in the US. 1. There is the kind which has concentrated benefits with a diffused cost: like raising everyone's taxes 4 cents per year to build a bridge in St. Paul, MN. The cost is diffused because 4 cents is nothing and the full cost is spread out, thus barely noticeable. For the people of St. Paul, this bridge could be immensely important and they could each derive hundreds or thousands of dollars of use out of this bridge every year. When it comes time to lobby or petition, you only stand to lose 4 cents while the residents of St. Paul can conceivably gain *a lot of money* if the bill passes. Understandly, they will always lobby harder for the bill to pass than Mr. Cheapskate taxpayer will lobby for it to not pass. 2. There is the kind which has concentrated cost with diffused benefits. Often, society as a whole (or just a majority) over-estimate the benefit they will derive from this legislation and lobby strongly for it. However, the money for this spending is being levied from a single source like the tobacco industry. An example would be a bill that lowered your taxes by .5% while levying an additional 5% tax on profits and 10% consumption tax on tobacco companies. Obviously, tobacco companies would fight this because it directly threatens them. So here is why lobbying is a double-edged sword. It is often the only chance that those targeted for a concentrated cost have to combat the majority. They can band together, pile in their money, and fight like there's no tomorrow to avoid the *tyranny of the majority*. The negative side to lobbying is that a small group of people can also ask for a favor in the tax code which costs the public very little individually while granting public money to a small group. Lobbying isn't good or bad, it is a tactic. It's used pretty often for both reasons.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1gquzj","post_title":"I don't believe lobbying is ethically or morally right.

{"comment_text":"What's the matter with lobbying? Nothing. This is a natural and necessary part of a Democracy. You have 500+ people making decisions for a population of 300,000,000. They can't talk to all of us. We, unions, corporations, charities, energy companies, and banks, join or hire or donate to groups to represent our interests. These people go and do their best to influence politicians to represent their specific member base. My perspective is that the government has access to way to many goodies to hand out. We've concentrated an immense amount of money and power into the hands of a very small number of people and yet we are surprised when the decisions they make with our tax dollars, or our industries, or our schools, or our banks, or our cars, or our food, isn't in our best interest. I'm not saying that lobbying should be outlawed, I'm saying that when one kid on the playground gets to hand out all the toys, only the biggest and strongest kids (with the most buying power) get to make decisions that effect the whole play ground. The solution isn't to outlaw the big kids from trying to bargain, the solution is to not concentrate all the toys at one source.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1gquzj","post_title":"I don't believe lobbying is ethically or morally right.

{"comment_text":"The problem isn't that lobbying is morally wrong. It's just that the power to lobby isn't evenly distributed. A company can do tons of it by paying a team of lawyers. You can do a little by calling your senator, but you don't have the same amount of power. Effectively, the people who own the company have more voting power than you do. Even so, you could probably start a political organization to gather funds if it matters that much to you.

Anyway, in part 2 of the Jefferson series he blew my fucking mind when they went on a brief tangent about Israel and Palestine and why democrats refuse to call it a genocide. I realize that's not exactly what you're talking about here, but the logic behind it comes from the same place. If the US establishment gives the *tiniest* bit of legitimacy to it, they'd be forced to look at themselves and realize that it's exactly what we've been doing in countries around the world, and particularly in the global south, since our inception. Hell, since before our inception since we colonized the fuck out this continent under the British, but you get the idea. That's why they rail against all the immugrints terkin our jerbs, because if they looked at the real cause of the \"crisis\" it shed a whole lot of light on all the fucked up shit the US has done over the years, and their egos\/frail identities are built on too fragile of a foundation to handle such criticism - *and they know it*.

(No socioeconomic vertical mobility and no real equality policies, on the contrary, a mega gap that widens continuously). These poor local people are very exploitable and logically angered they cannot truly progress. In order to direct these people's anger away from the wealth hoarders, the wealth hoarders hire even cheaper people from other countries that are even more desperate and tell the enraged local poor people to focus on those newcomers (that are hired by these hoarders). Poor people in Europe owe nothing, they are owed mostly. And the immigrants speech is so retorted and cruel in many ways.

{"comment_text":"Eh, sorry but, I am Irish, a country which has never invaded\/colonised another country in its entire history, we are being completely overwhelmed with immigration regardless. There are plenty of other countries being overrun, who similarly have never invaded\/colonised anyone but their closest neighbours. For example, I don't believe canada has ever invaded India yet they are absolutely swamped with economic migrants from India. I really can't agree with your logic here. If we take India as an example. India was indeed colonised by the British until the early 20th century. But they have been independent since the end of WW2. They are an enormous source of economic migrants because their economy sucks, their society sucks for the majority, and their country is extremely corrupt. During the same period in which india was colonised, western europe was no utopia, and was completely ravaged by world wars 1 and 2, leaving basically all of europe bankrupt and short on manpower. So I think it's fair to say that both India and Europe suffered very turbulent times for the 1st half of the 20th century and relative peace (and independence) from then on. Yet, they have fared very differently. I am no fan of the brits, but I don't believe they bear any responsibility for the state of the Indian nation today. India has had long enough to make major course corrections over the past ~80 years to improve things. The British are not responsible for the caste system, extreme levels of corruption amongst Indian officials, and neglect of public services by the Indian government, all things which are major drivers of emigration.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dch3t1","post_title":"The Left has the only actual solution to immigration 'crises'","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LateStageCapitalism\/comments\/1dch3t1\/the_left_has_the_only_actual_solution_to\/","timestamp":1718010305.0,"char_len":1637,"word_len":271,"lang":"en"}

But like many, there is an increasing worry about immigration and the collapse of social cohesion in Western society. A refusal from those in power to address the growing, gaping divide in the West between native European populations (mostly conservative\/right) and 1st and 2nd generation migrant populations (mostly left) is what is driving Europe's shift to the right, along with a form of censorship, where people don't feel they can talk about immigration of the problems that come with so many new people with so many new (and sometimes incompatible) cultures, without being labeled as a bigot or a racist, therefore shutting down any honest debate.

{"comment_text":"It seems you're interested in a pretty contentious topic. Left-wing parties are internally divided on immigration, with some prioritizing the needs of native workers over those of immigrants. Right-wing parties often focus on criticizing left-wing policies. If right-wing parties want to enact change, there needs to be a dialogue with left-wing parties about implementing immigration policies. This dialogue should consider economic factors, cultural values, and political strategies. And you are throwing terms all over the place, sometimes liberal then next moment, left wing. I am very confused. Liberal isn't left wing. Liberals aim for gradual reform within the existing political and economic systems, such as advocating for incremental improvements in healthcare access & the left wing is mostly about more radical changes to achieve greater social equality and justice, such as pushing for a single-payer healthcare system or even abolishing capitalism in favor of socialism.","platform":"reddit","post_id":"1dch3t1","post_title":"The Left has the only actual solution to immigration 'crises'","post_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LateStageCapitalism\/comments\/1dch3t1\/the_left_has_the_only_actual_solution_to\/","timestamp":1718010305.0,"char_len":990,"word_len":145,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Who cares, they bombed their own population for 8 years from 2014-2022 with the US and the collective west's blessings, funding, training and arming, they (Ukraine and the west) lied during peace negotiations of the civil war instigated by the west and then refused to negotiate when Russia intervened, they threw away a true peace, an intact country and EU membership, they ripped it up and threw it in Russia's face! You reap what you sow! The British BS Corporation is part of the problem not the solution. It's ok when we do it!!!!!!!!!!!! \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd21s .None of this has anything to do with Ukraine and everything to do with the US aim of separating the EU block politically and economically from Russia in favor of the US. Just another proxy western proxy war based of greed. Everyday, that the US and collective west refuse to address Russia's legitimate security concerns, Ukraine become a little bit smaller, while the UK, France and Poland rub their hands at Germany's self-inflicted deindustrialisation all jockeying for the top spot; greed plain and simple.

{"comment_text":"Zelensky didn't try to prevent the conflict through diplomacy because he lacks honor and integrity. In 2014 there was a coup. Soon after, there was a massacre in Odessa (dozens of people were burned alive). Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. A civil war broke out due to the rise in ethnic tensions. For 8 years the Ukrainian military was indiscriminately shelling civilians living in Donbas. If Zelensky honored the Minsk agreement and pledged neutrality, none of this would have happened. The 8 year civil war would have ended and Donbas would have remained part of Ukraine. War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy. Zelensky, Poroshenko, Merkel and Hollande admitted that Ukraine had no intention to honor the Minsk agreements. Who didn't want peace? Who advised against the 2022 peace talks in April? Hint: someone visited Zelensky in Kiev at that time. Russia's national security was compromised once NATO began to expand eastwards. Russia clearly stated that Ukraine joining NATO was a red line (November 2021) and unfortunately this concern was never taken seriously. The Russians openly stated: if nothing changes, we will be forced to act in order to defend our national security. Enhancing the national security of one country at the expense of another is unacceptable. The Russians have legitimate security concerns. 20th September, 2021: Ukraine launched military drills with US and NATO. NATO is not a defensive alliance. NATO illegally bombed Yugoslavia (a direct violation of the U.N. Charter). We should never forget what they did to Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq etc. Who blew up the pipeline causing an environmental disaster? Zelensky banned all opposition and arrested a leading priest. Zelensky tried to invoke article 5 under false pretenses. Remember the incident in Poland. Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. Poroshenko said, \u201cOur children will go to schools and kindergartens\u2014theirs will hide in the basements\u201d. Russians will never forget the 2014 Odessa massacre. The whole world needs to know about it. Why was Denis Kireev eliminated? He was a member of Ukraine's negotiating team during the peace negotiations. He wanted to help his country. Ukraine has a hit list. They target artists, journalists and ordinary citizens. Hundreds of children are on this list. 13 year old Faina Savenkova was placed on this list. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters is on this list. Jimmy Dore (American stand-up comedian, podcaster) and Aaron Mat\u00e9 (Canadian writer and journalist) are on this list. There is evidence that Ukrainian troops have been indiscriminately shelling civilians in Donbas (they used petal mines and targeted areas where there was no military presence). The azov troops trapped in the azovstal steelworks in Mariupol used human shields. They refused to allow civilians to leave despite of humanitarian corridors being present. Russia held a proposed cease fire in order for the civilians to leave, but azov would not allow the civilians to leave. Ukraine has committed many acts of terrorism (car bombs and other forms of assassination). Darya Dugina (journalist) R.I.P. The first terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge killed the truck driver and the individuals in the adjacent car (innocent civilian victims). The second terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge killed two parents and severely injured their young daughter. I have done a lot of research and it took me a long time to write this comment. I have stated a lot of facts and I have given my honest opinion. I have provided a brief summary of events that took place. In order to explain this whole situation in great detail, a book would need to be written. Hopefully someone will write an UNBIASED book, stating facts and allowing the readers to form their own judgments.

America has never been so afraid of putting anyone in the place of Putin, one question is only because Russia does not threaten America yet? And America is ready to turn a blind eye to the murders and absorption of other territories and simply pretend that this is not our war? America has become weak and it was Putin who showed its weakness, for that, of course, he has great respect. now the NATO countries will think about their security for the future, and America is no longer a force and a support, because it watched as Russia absorbed and destroyed Ukraine for 10 years, and Trump was at the beginning of this conflict, he did not decide anything then, and now he is speaking 24 hours will end the war, although probably 240 have already passed and nothing has changed.","platform":"youtube","post_id":"DclADBRw0zg","post_title":"Russia attacks Ukraine energy infrastructure with missiles and drones | BBC News","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DclADBRw0zg","timestamp":"2024-11-17T13:30:11Z","char_len":1036,"word_len":188,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Guys! Have you not seen Trump's bill that you can watch congress debate over, that gives a 4.5 trillion dollar tax cut to billionaires and millionaires while cutting over a trillion dollars that goes to vets, the elderly and a bunch stuck in poverty, also raised taxes if you make under 450k. Look up how tariffs work. We pay directly to Trump's treasury as even more spending money for him. Why is he expanding the DOD budget by another 150 billion instead of investigating them for the hundreds of billions a year they hide from our representatives. Look up the account of I think one of his attorneys that was taken from house arrest and thrown into solitary confinement for not signing a paper refusing to speak to media or write a book about Trump. Firing federal employees requires reason and a 30 day notice to Congress, dismantling agencies requires Congress. Trump and Elon are dismantling our checks and balances to basically turn us into Russia 2.0","platform":"youtube","post_id":"BnpL4VYBD0Y","post_title":"LIVE: President Donald Trump's Address to Congress","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BnpL4VYBD0Y","timestamp":"2025-03-05T04:54:35Z","char_len":959,"word_len":167,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says \"the soul that sins shall die\". BUT, mercy said \"I dont want to give them what they deserve. I don't want them to be cut off from Me. I love them despite all they have done\/will do against Me. I want to give My children another chance. I want them to come home and live in My love again\". And love said \"Jesus, God's Son, came down as a Man, our representative, suffering every temptation, pain and struggle we have ever faced, yet without sin. He took all our sins (past\/present\/ even future) to the cross and then crucified EVERY ONE on our behalf. Justice was paid on the cross so that we can be free from Hell's punishment, experience Gods mercy of forgiveness of sin and live in His love. If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (turn away from our sin and pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him (not ourselves as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction). So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to obey His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, or struggling or doubtful, simply be honest and tell Him that. He is not intimidated by ANY sin or struggle you are facing. ANY. He hears and will answer. If we pray for Him to come in, regardless of the condition, then He will. NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. If you have any questions let me know X","platform":"youtube","post_id":"dclIIEHeyVY","post_title":"MASSIVE TEMU Tech Gadget Haul!

{"comment_text":"The KZs are very cool and have awesome sound. I have so far ordered 2 pairs, the KZ EDX which is the low end like $15 set that sounds incredible and I also bought a set called the CCA C12 which I think is also by the KZ people and has 5BA, and 1DD which is 6 drives in each ear hence the C12 part of the name. Haven't got them yet but they were $55 and if they are 4x the price of the EDX then I'm hoping for 4X the sound.","platform":"youtube","post_id":"dclIIEHeyVY","post_title":"MASSIVE TEMU Tech Gadget Haul!

{"comment_text":"Not that interested in Temu, but still curious so I clicked and it was actually really enjoyable. Sometimes it's nice to just see the genuine reaction of people to products without over analysing them. I guess with Temu its cheap and does the job, the average buyer wont care about the specs as long as it functions. In future videos, would be nice if you edited in a pic of the listing for each product just for a glance, or share the price. But definitely keep up the good work!!!","platform":"youtube","post_id":"dclIIEHeyVY","post_title":"MASSIVE TEMU Tech Gadget Haul!

{"comment_text":"Let's be real, Palmer lacks ability to play as a team with a system, proven by why he did not fit in Pep's system at city, while he also works with poch bcs poch lacks system. The team back then was playing around Palmer thus made him a superstar. Enzo is now playing with a system and the system is good, or better at least. Palmer needs to realise he is a part of a system.

I have two challenges: 1. How do I conduct a PR when I'm a new hire? 2. The company policy states that employees are supposed to be responsible and should give themselves PR scores on the objectives agreed on at the beginning of the year. How do I tackle this issue? Am I supposed to convince each person I conduct a PR with that they should have given themselves lower scores on certain areas based on facts I've gathered from working with them for only three months?

{"comment_text":"If you are like me and work a daily, in-person job, but love traveling, it can be hard to accept that the full time travel lifestyle may not happen for you. I know i struggle with this. My skills cannot be translated to a remote position. So, you have two options: shift careers, or make the most of what you can. If your company gives you federal holidays off, this can be a great way to maximize your vacation time. Look up \"maximize vacation days\" to get a great calendar that can turn 11 days of PTO into 44 throughout the year. Another great way to get some longer travel in is to plan around your career. In the video she talked about leaving to travel between leases but you could also add travel between jobs. I live with my parents so I thankfully dont need to worry about rent, but i do need to worry about having time off. When I left my job last year i already had a new one lined up, but i made sure to leave a week between them so i could fly to Iceland and have some carefree travel time before starting my new position. So if you find yourself looking at a job switch, take advantage! and also ALWAYS tell your new company you have a preplanned vacation before you join. In my experience, they will usually let me take the time as leave without pay, which is perfect for me since i travel pretty cheap (not hostels and backpacking, but fairly cheap). If you cant afford LWOP or they wont give it to you, at least you could possible take the time off earlier than you could have built it up normally. Ive considered making my own video along these lines of, making the most of traveling when you cant live this idyllic nomadic lifestyle. It's something a lot of people cant do and it gets harder the more commitments you have. but it is possible. I also encourage everyone to try day or weekend hikes in your home areas. I dont have a lot of interesting places in my town but an hour away, the appalachian mountains lie waiting and ive never taken advantage of that until recently. Even if your hometown has little to do, i have been finding wonderful day hikes that i try to do every weekend to preserve that feeling of adventure. And i guess thats really what is important for me. Going to europe and seeing the world is amazing, but not always possible for me. so as long as i am finding that sense of adventure in my week-to-week life, it keeps me going and keeps me excited for my next big trip. Hopefully this is insightful to anyone who is in a similar position to me. Im 24 and still figuring it out myself, and welcome anyone who has more experience with this kind of travel to give me advice. But this is what ive found works for me so far. keep traveling!","platform":"youtube","post_id":"iPvdI7ibGHc","post_title":"How to Travel in Your 20s: Budget Travel Opportunities While You\u2019re Young & Making Travel Friends","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iPvdI7ibGHc","timestamp":"2023-09-28T00:10:25Z","char_len":2683,"word_len":510,"lang":"en"}

The truth is if you want to travel cheap you are sacrificing comfort and convenience, it\u2019s not a vacation. Travel during the off season, cook your own food, and only take the overnight Flixbuses so you don\u2019t have to pay for a hostel.

{"comment_text":"Many good points. Don't forget to learn about the culture of places you are going. Some places have more defined or expected cultures than others. An American in London is pretty easy aside from learning different words they use for things. Going to a place driven by a deep culture like Japan without learning do's and don'ts is a recipe for problems and is hard on the Japanese. Safety is a lot about confidence and listening to your gut. But one can research that about a given place as well. Lastly, as \"travel influencers\" are being increasingly viewed as predatory and problematic around the world please don't be one and just be enriched by your travel and be good to the locals.","platform":"youtube","post_id":"iPvdI7ibGHc","post_title":"How to Travel in Your 20s: Budget Travel Opportunities While You\u2019re Young & Making Travel Friends","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iPvdI7ibGHc","timestamp":"2023-09-28T00:10:25Z","char_len":688,"word_len":122,"lang":"en"}

I am considering taking a break for 6 months up to 2 years to the uk on the tier 5 visa (I'm from Australia). With this visa I can still visit europe also. I'm thinking of starting off with staying in hostels or guest rooms in airbnbs - not as cheap as a hostel but relatively close and I think it would be great to get local tips from the host. I'm thinking I would then want to try a workaway (I'm also hoping this will give me something to occupy myself with while away I'm thinking either hostel work or au pair style (I have experience working with children so am leaning toward au pair, but also the idea of being with a big group in a hostel is cool too!). Seriously I wish I knew more people like you, it's inspiring to hear from someone who loves the travel\/nomadic lifestyle and is conscious with how they use their money. I've been saying for such a long time that I was going to spend a lot of time travel. I'm almost 26 now, so I feel like next year is as good a time as ever! I've also saved up a decent chunk of money for the first time in my life because I've been saving for an apartment, but I would love to travel (without blowing too much of it) before I consider purchasing a place to settle in! Another great vid.","platform":"youtube","post_id":"iPvdI7ibGHc","post_title":"How to Travel in Your 20s: Budget Travel Opportunities While You\u2019re Young & Making Travel Friends","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iPvdI7ibGHc","timestamp":"2023-09-28T00:10:25Z","char_len":1395,"word_len":270,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude80 Oh my stars, this video and the passion behind these astronomical feats have left me utterly speechless! The sheer brilliance of the scientists and engineers who\u2019ve poured their hearts into projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Voyager probes is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Watching this, I was transported back to a chilly night last summer when I attended a stargazing event at a local observatory. As the telescope revealed Saturn\u2019s rings in crisp detail, I felt a lump in my throat\u2014a mix of wonder and gratitude for the human ingenuity that lets us peer into the cosmos. That moment, standing under a blanket of stars, made me feel so small yet so connected to the universe, much like @Marius-Cristian\u2019s beautiful reflection on our \u201cpale blue dot.\u201d \ud83c\udf0d\u2728 The enthusiasm of these scientists, as @brother_of_bruh noted, is contagious\u2014it\u2019s like watching kids unwrapping their wildest dreams! I can relate to @philmutonhodza7899\u2019s sentiment about finding perspective through astronomy. Whenever life feels overwhelming, I look up at the night sky or dive into content like this, and suddenly my worries shrink against the vastness of it all. The fact that we, as a species, can create machines to touch the sun (@Pendergasted\u2019s discovery of the Parker Solar Probe!) or capture galaxies billions of light-years away is a testament to what we can achieve when we unite, as @paulmaggiar8274 so aptly said. This channel\u2019s ability to deliver such intelligent, unbiased content (@ricardioscarbonara102 hit the nail on the head!) is why I keep coming back. It\u2019s not just about the mind-boggling tech or the breathtaking images that make @Lizzymint emotional\u2014it\u2019s the reminder that we\u2019re part of something extraordinary. I\u2019m inspired to share this with my younger cousin, hoping it sparks the same curiosity in her that @IdealConscience wants for their daughter. To every scientist, engineer, and dreamer behind these missions: you\u2019re my heroes. Thank you for showing us the universe\u2019s beauty and our place in it. \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\ude4c Keep shining, BBC and Science Time!","platform":"youtube","post_id":"pJZQlX2Fs7A","post_title":"Exploring our Mind-Blowing Universe | BBC Earth Science","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pJZQlX2Fs7A","timestamp":"2023-12-04T21:00:34Z","char_len":2065,"word_len":331,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"The JWST mission was comically over budget, about a decade over its deadline, but it was WORTH EVERY SINGLE BIT OF IT! The telescope is such a monumental leap in technology and it would allow the scientists to see things that were previously never seen before. Personally, I still have a special place for the Hubble Space Telescope, mainly because it was launched when I was a kid and had just started to become interested in astronomy and space exploration. I remember the first images from Hubble being terrible due to the slight deformation of the mirror because the scientists hadn\u2019t considered the effects of microgravity on the shape of the primary mirror. The astronomy community was so disappointed and the media was calling the mission a failure, which was ridiculous, but it was definitely an embarrassment for NASA. However they sent a team up to the telescope to install a software modification to basically adapt the optics like what\u2019s done by the ground based telescopes. The images were astounding. But now that its life is coming to an end, the JWST will take its place in history","platform":"youtube","post_id":"pJZQlX2Fs7A","post_title":"Exploring our Mind-Blowing Universe | BBC Earth Science","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pJZQlX2Fs7A","timestamp":"2023-12-04T21:00:34Z","char_len":1097,"word_len":188,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I watched the video for 30 minutes and 38 seconds. It astounded me blissfully, and then I began to think. Human species, specifically scientists, take God out of the equation. Why would no one let their hearts and spirits understand that God designed the universe? What mind could create a solar system so finely tuned and sustainable as it does? Only the Almighty Lord of heaven and earth could do it. The scientists said the satellite kept traveling through space and did not reach an edge, which made me think. Space has no end because God has no end in Himself. God is not limited to anything He creates. Space cannot be contained. Why, then, does God contain God in the things God makes? Space? This thought was uttered by King David centuries past: \u201cBut will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!\u201d 2 Chronicles\u202c \u202d6\u202c:\u202d18\u202c \u202dKJV\u202c\u202c David knew from his close relationship with God that God was infinitely more than his mind could comprehend. He knew God could not be limited or bounded by anything humans made for him. He knew the heavens were far more spacious to contain God. Not even space contains God. Partly, one can attain God because God is so far beyond our comprehension. God has to come down to us.

It reminds me that, as Earthlings, we're special and our existence is a remarkable gift. We may be the Alien that we are looking for, Earthlings are special Forgive me, I don't know what I am writing about..ramblings of an impressed man","platform":"youtube","post_id":"pJZQlX2Fs7A","post_title":"Exploring our Mind-Blowing Universe | BBC Earth Science","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pJZQlX2Fs7A","timestamp":"2023-12-04T21:00:34Z","char_len":937,"word_len":158,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I'm going to be 15 this month and I'm in the tenth grade. Back in Nigeria, you don't have that chance to decide what you want for a long time. From ninth grade, you have to choose one out of three departments that will eventually decide what you're going to study in college (also, people are around 13\/14 in the ninth grade back there) so A LOT of students would switch departments by the second semester(there are three semesters) or sometimes it gets so bad that they go back to the ninth grade. So being here where you can be anything you want is thrilling. I want to Major in Psychology (and get a master's and Psyd in Forensic Psychology) but I also love government and literature and am also interested in cinematography (I want to get a camera by the end of the year) is it possible to get government, literature, and cinematography as electives, or am I living a pipe dream","platform":"youtube","post_id":"eGR2Yf6yBRA","post_title":"How to Choose a Major | Crash Course | How to College","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eGR2Yf6yBRA","timestamp":"2022-05-05T22:00:13Z","char_len":882,"word_len":163,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I'm graduating in December (a semester early!) with a triple major so while I choose a major... I just did it again and then again again (it's rarely too late to modify your plan if you find the need\/want). So, the balancing classes and life is particularly important, but also knowing how to plan your desired college experience is important... though I imagine that it's simpler when you're taking less complex majors. Also, it's important to note that not all majors have equal course loads and the type of assignments can differ from major to major (I haven't really had tests in my majors, instead being paper and project heavy... but other majors have a lot more tests).","platform":"youtube","post_id":"eGR2Yf6yBRA","post_title":"How to Choose a Major | Crash Course | How to College","post_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eGR2Yf6yBRA","timestamp":"2022-05-05T22:00:13Z","char_len":676,"word_len":118,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Depending on your specific colleges legal credentials also comes into what you can reasonably do, and also their learning curriculum as well. Say for my college that I attended. You are able to be very flexible in your minors, but your primary major is rather rigid. So I have a mechanical engineering technology major at the Bachelors level. HOWEVER if I wanted to I could and could've had a minor in materials with a focus on stainless steels due to having a materials course within the realm of stainless steels, and if I took a secondary even more niche course on stainless steels on top of the first required class I could have a main major and a materials minor. This can also be spun to expand your main major as well. Instead of simply going all in for a Masters level of a realm of study you can simply build with your main majors base to also have another major as well. For me personally I could go full in Mechanical Engineering which is more heavily theory based engineering (more drafting, theory, and desk work) simply by attending for another semester or 2 classes wise at my university because my MET degree goes right into the core building blocks of an ME degree minus the higher level chemistry and physics. So you can flex your degrees and majors via how your school does them. My school is smart in that they outright differ from being engineering using the crutch of calculus to weed out the riff raff with instead being algebra oriented. This allows for more focus on core problem solving that can be applied to many realms of study while still also having calculus being a core but not a make or break major facet of the learning curriculum. On top of this they can have a sort of built in filtering setup for how their classes are oriented. My school has it to where all lower courses for the realm of engineering touch base on electrical, computer, engineering, and technology realms of learning. Depending on what you love, or excel at is where my mentors\/professors would chime in in saying \"hey you do well in this would you want to pursue it?\" Along with setting up talks or discussions with previous or current students both studying, and working to let you get glimpses of the field of work to make better decisions. ALSO THERE IS NO SHAME OR STIGMA IN TAKING LOWER COURSES AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES BEFORE GOING TO THE PERCIEVED \"BIG NAME SCHOOLS\"!!! ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE SCHOOL IS ACCREDITED AND ALSO THAT YOUR CREDIT HOURS TRANSFER!!!!!!!! May any and all who pursue higher education excel, and prosper! (Also for those currently in the grind. Yes it's a dark moment to second guess yourself. But you will make it through it. Failure isn't the end of the world. You can do it! Keep trying, and also possibly try a different professor because that works too.

{"comment_text":"The two languages are related (both are Northwest Semtic languages) and eventually shared a script. Hebrew, prior to the exile used its own script called Paleo-Hebrew. It was still used afterwards in isolated places and instances, but what we now call Aramaic Square replaced it for the most part. Though they share many common words and large pieces of grammar (noun states are the same and verbal stems are similar), there are differences. It is these differences in grammar that allow us to tell them apart: The definite article differs between the two languages. In Hebrew, the definite article is prefixed to the noun as a he . In Aramaic, the definite article is attached to the end of the noun as an aleph . Aramaic has a particle \"diy\" that can be used in at least 5 ways (Hebrew does not use this until postexilic times and even then rarely). To mark the genitive - Daniel 4:23 \"roots of the tree.\" As a particle of relation (who, which, that) - Dan 2:24 \" whom the king had appointed.\" As the conjunction \"as\"- Dan 4:23 \"And as it was commanded...\". To function as opening quotation marks - Dan 2:24 \"Said to him, 'I found...\". As an idiom - Dan 2:29 \" whatever will be\". Aramaic uses \"l\" in 3 ways. As a preposition, \"to, for\" - Dan 3:20 \" to the furnance.\" To mark the infinitive - Dan 3:20 \"ordered to bind ...\". As the mark of the accusative - Dan 3:20 \"to bind Shadrack .\" (Yes, it gets a lot of use in that verse.) Aramaic can use \"diy\" and \"l\" to mark that part of a construct chain is indefinite (in Biblical Hebrew, such a chain must be either all definite or all indefinite). Dan 6:15 \"Remember, O King, that a law of the Medes and Persians.. does not change.\" The \"a\" comes from law being indefinite even though Medes and Persians is not (by definition, even without the article). However, the \"l\" prefixed to Medes tells us that the first part is not definite. The participle can be used in Aramaic in ways that Hebrew does not. With immediate future meaning \"about to\" Dan 4:22 \" About to be driven.\" As a 'past tense' \u2014 very common in the phrase \"answered and said.\" There are letter changes. Hebrew words with \"sh\" will often appear in Aramaic spelt with a \"t.\" For example, Daniel 5:25 contains \"mene, mene, teqel upharsin.\" \"teqel\" is the Aramaic spelling of \"sheqel.\" Aramaic did not experience the Canaanite vowel shift from a to o that Hebrew did.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"2915","post_title":"Given the differences between Hebrew and Aramaic, how are the Aramaic sections identified?","post_url":"https:\/\/hermeneutics.stackexchange.com\/questions\/2915\/given-the-differences-between-hebrew-and-aramaic-how-are-the-aramaic-sections-i#12483","timestamp":"2013-01-05T03:42:15","char_len":2454,"word_len":434,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"They are both west Semitic and have a very obvious shared root language. They also use the same script. However, there are a handful of differences in the way they developed. For instance, the long 'a' was retained in Aramaic but changed to a long 'o' in Hebrew in some words. Also, where we see a tav in Aramaic, there is often a shin in Hebrew. This is likely because the original \"hl\" (voiceless L) pronunciation of shin shifted to \"th\" in some areas and \"sh\" in others.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"2915","post_title":"Given the differences between Hebrew and Aramaic, how are the Aramaic sections identified?","post_url":"https:\/\/hermeneutics.stackexchange.com\/questions\/2915\/given-the-differences-between-hebrew-and-aramaic-how-are-the-aramaic-sections-i#12483","timestamp":"2013-01-05T03:42:15","char_len":475,"word_len":88,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Hebrew and Aramaic are both West Semitic languages with common ancestry in Phoenician and Canaanite roots. Hebrew is about 200 years older, and based on a Canaanite dialect spoken around Jerusalem. Aramaic originated in Damascus, Syria, not Assyria which is modern day Iraq. Aramaic was used by the conquering Assyrians and Persians in their occupied lands because it was easier to teach than their own languages. Hebrew stopped being spoken and written after the Exile. Aramaic became the lingua franca. Later replaced by Greek. Ezra's copyists transferred the Hebrew content of the OT to newer manuscripts with Aramaic script! But everyone spoke Aramaic, not Hebrew! Torah was recopied during Ezra's time using a different script. Different reasons are given for the change: the change of script had nothing to do with the \"Samaritans\", but was a purely practical measure because after living for 70 years in Babylon the people had become used to reading ashuri script and couldn't read the old ivri script any more. The original script was Ashuri script, it was the holy script with which the first Tablets were inscribed and also the Torah-scroll that was kept in the Holy of Holies, but never used for mundane purposes. Torahs written for mass study and synagoge use were written in Ivri script, out of reverence for the holy. Only a few sages passed on the tradition of the Ashuri script. The people didn't even know of its existence. That's why when the \"handwriting on the wall\" appeared not even the king's Jewish advisors could read it because it was written in Ashuri, only Daniel could. Then it became known that there was an ancient truly Jewish script that had become forgotten. The people were anxious to renew this link with the giving of Torah. And that's why Ezra taught it to them and they choose to use it in all their sacred writings from that time on.

{"comment_text":"You are a victim of branch prediction fail. What is Branch Prediction? Consider a railroad junction: Image by Mecanismo, via Wikimedia Commons. Used under the CC-By-SA 3.0 license. Now for the sake of argument, suppose this is back in the 1800s - before long-distance or radio communication. You are a blind operator of a junction and you hear a train coming. You have no idea which way it is supposed to go. You stop the train to ask the driver which direction they want. And then you set the switch appropriately. Trains are heavy and have a lot of inertia, so they take forever to start up and slow down. Is there a better way? You guess which direction the train will go! If you guessed right, it continues on. If you guessed wrong, the driver will stop, back up, and yell at you to flip the switch. Then it can restart down the other path. If you guess right every time , the train will never have to stop. If you guess wrong too often , the train will spend a lot of time stopping, backing up, and restarting. Consider an if-statement: At the processor level, it is a branch instruction: You are a processor and you see a branch. You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete. Then you continue down the correct path. Modern processors are complicated and have long pipelines. This means they take forever to \"warm up\" and \"slow down\". Is there a better way? You guess which direction the branch will go! If you guessed right, you continue executing. If you guessed wrong, you need to flush the pipeline and roll back to the branch. Then you can restart down the other path. If you guess right every time , the execution will never have to stop. If you guess wrong too often , you spend a lot of time stalling, rolling back, and restarting. This is branch prediction. I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment. How would you strategically guess to minimize the number of times that the train must back up and go down the other path? You look at the past history! If the train goes left 99% of the time, then you guess left. If it alternates, then you alternate your guesses. If it goes one way every three times, you guess the same... In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it. This is more or less how branch predictors work. Most applications have well-behaved branches. Therefore, modern branch predictors will typically achieve >90% hit rates. But when faced with unpredictable branches with no recognizable patterns, branch predictors are virtually useless. Further reading: \"Branch predictor\" article on Wikipedia . As hinted from above, the culprit is this if-statement: if (data[c] >= 128) sum += data[c]; Notice that the data is evenly distributed between 0 and 255. When the data is sorted, roughly the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement. After that, they will all enter the if-statement. This is very friendly to the branch predictor since the branch consecutively goes the same direction many times. Even a simple saturating counter will correctly predict the branch except for the few iterations after it switches direction. Quick visualization: T = branch taken N = branch not taken data[] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ... 250, 251, 252, ... branch = N N N N N ... N N T T T ... T T T ... = NNNNNNNNNNNN ... NNNNNNNTTTTTTTTT ... TTTTTTTTTT (easy to predict) However, when the data is completely random, the branch predictor is rendered useless, because it can't predict random data. Thus there will probably be around 50% misprediction (no better than random guessing). data[] = 226, 185, 125, 158, 198, 144, 217, 79, 202, 118, 14, 150, 177, 182, ... branch = T, T, N, T, T, T, T, N, T, N, N, T, T, T ... = TTNTTTTNTNNTTT ... (completely random - impossible to predict) What can be done? If the compiler isn't able to optimize the branch into a conditional move, you can try some hacks if you are willing to sacrifice readability for performance. Replace: if (data[c] >= 128) sum += data[c]; with: int t = (data[c] - 128) >> 31; sum += ~t & data[c]; This eliminates the branch and replaces it with some bitwise operations. (Note that this hack is not strictly equivalent to the original if-statement. But in this case, it's valid for all the input values of data[] .)

With the Hack: There is no difference between sorted and unsorted data. In the C++ case, the hack is actually a tad slower than with the branch when the data is sorted. A general rule of thumb is to avoid data-dependent branching in critical loops (such as in this example). Update: GCC 4.6.1 with -O3 or -ftree-vectorize on x64 is able to generate a conditional move, so there is no difference between the sorted and unsorted data - both are fast. This is called \"if-conversion\" (to branchless) and is necessary for vectorization but also sometimes good for scalar. (Or somewhat fast: for the already-sorted case, cmov can be slower especially if GCC puts it on the critical path instead of just add , especially on Intel before Broadwell where cmov has 2-cycle latency: gcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2 ) VC++ 2010 is unable to generate conditional moves for this branch even under \/Ox . Intel C++ Compiler (ICC) 11 does something miraculous. It interchanges the two loops , thereby hoisting the unpredictable branch to the outer loop. Not only is it immune to the mispredictions, it's also twice as fast as whatever VC++ and GCC can generate! In other words, ICC took advantage of the test-loop to defeat the benchmark... If you give the Intel compiler the branchless code, it just outright vectorizes it... and is just as fast as with the branch (with the loop interchange). Clang also vectorizes the if() version, as will GCC 5 and later with -O3 , even though it takes quite a few instructions to sign-extend to the 64-bit sum on x86 without SSE4 or AVX2. ( -march=x86-64-v2 or v3 ). See Why is processing an unsorted array the same speed as processing a sorted array with modern x86-64 clang?

{"comment_text":"The reason why performance improves drastically when the data is sorted is that the branch prediction penalty is removed, as explained beautifully in Mysticial's answer . Now, if we look at the code if (data[c] >= 128) sum += data[c]; we can find that the meaning of this particular if... else... branch is to add something when a condition is satisfied. This type of branch can be easily transformed into a conditional move statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: cmovl , in an x86 system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed. In C , thus C++ , the statement, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in x86 , is the ternary operator ... ? ... : ... . So we rewrite the above statement into an equivalent one: sum += data[c] >=128 ? data[c] : 0; While maintaining readability, we can check the speedup factor. On an Intel Core i7 -2600K @ 3.4 GHz and Visual Studio 2010 Release Mode, the benchmark is: x86 Scenario Time (seconds) Branching - Random data 8.885 Branching - Sorted data 1.528 Branchless - Random data 3.716 Branchless - Sorted data 3.71 x64 Scenario Time (seconds) Branching - Random data 11.302 Branching - Sorted data 1.830 Branchless - Random data 2.736 Branchless - Sorted data 2.737 The result is robust in multiple tests. We get a great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern. Now let's look more closely by investigating the x86 assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions max1 and max2 . max1 uses the conditional branch if... else ... : int max1(int a, int b) { if (a > b) return a; else return b; } max2 uses the ternary operator ... ? ... : ... : int max2(int a, int b) { return a > b ? a : b; } On an x86-64 machine, GCC -S generates the assembly below. :max1 movl %edi, -4(%rbp) movl %esi, -8(%rbp) movl -4(%rbp), %eax cmpl -8(%rbp), %eax jle .L2 movl -4(%rbp), %eax movl %eax, -12(%rbp) jmp .L4 .L2: movl -8(%rbp), %eax movl %eax, -12(%rbp) .L4: movl -12(%rbp), %eax leave ret :max2 movl %edi, -4(%rbp) movl %esi, -8(%rbp) movl -4(%rbp), %eax cmpl %eax, -8(%rbp) cmovge -8(%rbp), %eax leave ret max2 uses much less code due to the usage of instruction cmovge . But the real gain is that max2 does not involve branch jumps, jmp , which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right. So why does a conditional move perform better? In a typical x86 processor, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called pipelining . In a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we cannot do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict. In a conditional move case, the execution of conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like Fetch and Decode do not depend on the result of the previous instruction; only the latter stages need the result. Thus, we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when the prediction is easy. The book Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition explains this in detail. You can check Section 3.6.6 for Conditional Move Instructions , entire Chapter 4 for Processor Architecture , and Section 5.11.2 for special treatment for Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties . Sometimes, some modern compilers can optimize our code to assembly with better performance, and sometimes some compilers can't (the code in question is using Visual Studio's native compiler). Knowing the performance difference between a branch and a conditional move when unpredictable can help us write code with better performance when the scenario gets so complex that the compiler can not optimize them automatically.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11227809\/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":4489,"word_len":703,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I just read up on this question and its answers, and I feel an answer is missing. A common way to eliminate branch prediction that I've found to work particularly good in managed languages is a table lookup instead of using a branch (although I haven't tested it in this case). This approach works in general if: it's a small table and is likely to be cached in the processor, and you are running things in a quite tight loop and\/or the processor can preload the data. Background and why From a processor perspective, your memory is slow. To compensate for the difference in speed, a couple of caches are built into your processor (L1\/L2 cache). So imagine that you're doing your nice calculations and figure out that you need a piece of memory. The processor will get its 'load' operation and loads the piece of memory into cache -- and then uses the cache to do the rest of the calculations. Because memory is relatively slow, this 'load' will slow down your program. Like branch prediction, this was optimized in the Pentium processors: the processor predicts that it needs to load a piece of data and attempts to load that into the cache before the operation actually hits the cache. As we've already seen, branch prediction sometimes goes horribly wrong -- in the worst case scenario you need to go back and actually wait for a memory load, which will take forever ( in other words: failing branch prediction is bad, a memory load after a branch prediction fail is just horrible! ). Fortunately for us, if the memory access pattern is predictable, the processor will load it in its fast cache and all is well. The first thing we need to know is what is small ? While smaller is generally better, a rule of thumb is to stick to lookup tables that are <= 4096 bytes in size. As an upper limit: if your lookup table is larger than 64K it's probably worth reconsidering. Constructing a table So we've figured out that we can create a small table. Next thing to do is get a lookup function in place. Lookup functions are usually small functions that use a couple of basic integer operations (and, or, xor, shift, add, remove and perhaps multiply). You want to have your input translated by the lookup function to some kind of 'unique key' in your table, which then simply gives you the answer of all the work you wanted it to do. In this case: >= 128 means we can keep the value, < 128 means we get rid of it. The easiest way to do that is by using an 'AND': if we keep it, we AND it with 7FFFFFFF; if we want to get rid of it, we AND it with 0. Notice also that 128 is a power of 2 -- so we can go ahead and make a table of 32768\/128 integers and fill it with one zero and a lot of 7FFFFFFFF's. Managed languages You might wonder why this works well in managed languages. After all, managed languages check the boundaries of the arrays with a branch to ensure you don't mess up... Well, not exactly... :-) There has been quite some work on eliminating this branch for managed languages. For example: for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; ++i) { \/\/ Use array[i] } In this case, it's obvious to the compiler that the boundary condition will never be hit. At least the Microsoft JIT compiler (but I expect Java does similar things) will notice this and remove the check altogether. WOW, that means no branch.

{"comment_text":"One way to avoid branch prediction errors is to build a lookup table, and index it using the data. Stefan de Bruijn discussed that in his answer. But in this case, we know values are in the range [0, 255] and we only care about values >= 128. That means we can easily extract a single bit that will tell us whether we want a value or not: by shifting the data to the right 7 bits, we are left with a 0 bit or a 1 bit, and we only want to add the value when we have a 1 bit. Let's call this bit the \"decision bit\". By using the 0\/1 value of the decision bit as an index into an array, we can make code that will be equally fast whether the data is sorted or not sorted. Our code will always add a value, but when the decision bit is 0, we will add the value somewhere we don't care about. Here's the code: \/\/ Test clock_t start = clock(); long long a[] = {0, 0}; long long sum; for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { \/\/ Primary loop for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c) { int j = (data[c] >> 7); a[j] += data[c]; } } double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock() - start) \/ CLOCKS_PER_SEC; sum = a[1]; This code wastes half of the adds but never has a branch prediction failure. It's tremendously faster on random data than the version with an actual if statement. But in my testing, an explicit lookup table was slightly faster than this, probably because indexing into a lookup table was slightly faster than bit shifting. This shows how my code sets up and uses the lookup table (unimaginatively called lut for \"LookUp Table\" in the code). Here's the C++ code: \/\/ Declare and then fill in the lookup table int lut[256]; for (unsigned c = 0; c < 256; ++c) lut[c] = (c >= 128) ? c : 0; \/\/ Use the lookup table after it is built for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { \/\/ Primary loop for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c) { sum += lut[data[c]]; } } In this case, the lookup table was only 256 bytes, so it fits nicely in a cache and all was fast. This technique wouldn't work well if the data was 24-bit values and we only wanted half of them... the lookup table would be far too big to be practical. On the other hand, we can combine the two techniques shown above: first shift the bits over, then index a lookup table. For a 24-bit value that we only want the top half value, we could potentially shift the data right by 12 bits, and be left with a 12-bit value for a table index. A 12-bit table index implies a table of 4096 values, which might be practical. The technique of indexing into an array, instead of using an if statement, can be used for deciding which pointer to use. I saw a library that implemented binary trees, and instead of having two named pointers ( pLeft and pRight or whatever) had a length-2 array of pointers and used the \"decision bit\" technique to decide which one to follow. For example, instead of: if (x < node->value) node = node->pLeft; else node = node->pRight; this library would do something like: i = (x < node->value); node = node->link[i]; Here's a link to this code: Red Black Trees , Eternally Confuzzled","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11227809\/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":3180,"word_len":594,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"In the sorted case, you can do better than relying on successful branch prediction or any branchless comparison trick: completely remove the branch. Indeed, the array is partitioned in a contiguous zone with data < 128 and another with data >= 128 .

{"comment_text":"The above behavior is happening because of Branch prediction. To understand branch prediction one must first understand an Instruction Pipeline. The the steps of running an instruction can be overlapped with the sequence of steps of running the previous and next instruction, so that different steps can be executed concurrently in parallel. This technique is known as instruction pipelining and is used to increase throughput in modern processors. To understand this better please see this example on Wikipedia . Generally, modern processors have quite long (and wide) pipelines, so many instruction can be in flight. See Modern Microprocessors A 90-Minute Guide! which starts by introducing basic in-order pipelining and goes from there. But for ease let's consider a simple in-order pipeline with these 4 steps only. (Like a classic 5-stage RISC , but omitting a separate MEM stage.) IF -- Fetch the instruction from memory ID -- Decode the instruction EX -- Execute the instruction WB -- Write back to CPU register 4-stage pipeline in general for 2 instructions. Moving back to the above question let's consider the following instructions: A) if (data[c] >= 128) \/\\ \/ \\ \/ \\ true \/ \\ false \/ \\ \/ \\ \/ \\ \/ \\ B) sum += data[c]; C) for loop or print(). Without branch prediction, the following would occur: To execute instruction B or instruction C the processor will have to wait ( stall ) till the instruction A leaves the EX stage in the pipeline, as the decision to go to instruction B or instruction C depends on the result of instruction A. (i.e. where to fetch from next.) So the pipeline will look like this: Without prediction: when if condition is true: Without prediction: When if condition is false: As a result of waiting for the result of instruction A, the total CPU cycles spent in the above case (without branch prediction; for both true and false) is 7. So what is branch prediction? Branch predictor will try to guess which way a branch (an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. It will not wait for the instruction A to reach the EX stage of the pipeline, but it will guess the decision and go to that instruction (B or C in case of our example). In case of a correct guess, the pipeline looks something like this: If it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay. The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good branch predictor . In the OP's code, the first time when the conditional, the branch predictor does not have any information to base up prediction, so the first time it will randomly choose the next instruction. (Or fall back to static prediction, typically forward not-taken, backward taken). Later in the for loop, it can base the prediction on the history. For an array sorted in ascending order, there are three possibilities: All the elements are less than 128 All the elements are greater than 128 Some starting new elements are less than 128 and later it become greater than 128 Let us assume that the predictor will always assume the true branch on the first run. So in the first case, it will always take the true branch since historically all its predictions are correct. In the 2nd case, initially it will predict wrong, but after a few iterations, it will predict correctly. In the 3rd case, it will initially predict correctly till the elements are less than 128. After which it will fail for some time and the correct itself when it sees branch prediction failure in history. In all these cases the failure will be too less in number and as a result, only a few times it will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch, resulting in fewer CPU cycles. But in case of a random unsorted array, the prediction will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch most of the time and result in more CPU cycles compared to the sorted array.

{"comment_text":"Frequently used Boolean operations in C++ produce many branches in the compiled program. If these branches are inside loops and are hard to predict they can slow down execution significantly. Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value 0 for false and 1 for true . Boolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than 0 or 1 , but operators that have Booleans as output can produce no other value than 0 or 1 . This makes operations with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary. Consider example: bool a, b, c, d; c = a && b; d = a || b; This is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way: bool a, b, c, d; if (a != 0) { if (b != 0) { c = 1; } else { goto CFALSE; } } else { CFALSE: c = 0; } if (a == 0) { if (b == 0) { d = 0; } else { goto DTRUE; } } else { DTRUE: d = 1; } This code is far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of mispredictions. The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than 0 and 1 . The reason why the compiler does not make such an assumption is that the variables might have other values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be optimized if a and b has been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this: char a = 0, b = 1, c, d; c = a & b; d = a | b; char is used instead of bool in order to make it possible to use the bitwise operators ( & and | ) instead of the Boolean operators ( && and || ). The bitwise operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator ( | ) works even if a and b have other values than 0 or 1 . The AND operator ( & ) and the EXCLUSIVE OR operator ( ^ ) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than 0 and 1 . ~ can not be used for NOT. Instead, you can make a Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be 0 or 1 by XOR'ing it with 1 : bool a, b; b = !a; can be optimized to: char a = 0, b; b = a ^ 1; a && b cannot be replaced with a & b if b is an expression that should not be evaluated if a is false ( && will not evaluate b , & will). Likewise, a || b can not be replaced with a | b if b is an expression that should not be evaluated if a is true . Using bitwise operators is more advantageous if the operands are variables than if the operands are comparisons: bool a; double x, y, z; a = x > y && z < 5.0; is optimal in most cases (unless you expect the && expression to generate many branch mispredictions).","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11227809\/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":2872,"word_len":568,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"As what has already been mentioned by others, what behind the mystery is Branch Predictor . I'm not trying to add something but explaining the concept in another way. There is a concise introduction on the wiki which contains text and diagram. I do like the explanation below which uses a diagram to elaborate the Branch Predictor intuitively. In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined microprocessor architectures such as x86. Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump instruction. A conditional jump can either be \"not taken\" and continue execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately after the conditional jump, or it can be \"taken\" and jump to a different place in program memory where the second branch of code is stored. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction pipeline (see fig. 1). Based on the described scenario, I have written an animation demo to show how instructions are executed in a pipeline in different situations. Without the Branch Predictor. Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline. The example contains three instructions and the first one is a conditional jump instruction. The latter two instructions can go into the pipeline until the conditional jump instruction is executed. It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed. Use Branch Predictor and don't take a conditional jump. Let's assume that the predict is not taking the conditional jump. It will take 7 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed. Use Branch Predictor and take a conditional jump. Let's assume that the predict is not taking the conditional jump. It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed. The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a more advanced branch predictor. As you can see, it seems we don't have a reason not to use Branch Predictor. It's quite a simple demo that clarifies the very basic part of Branch Predictor.

{"comment_text":"Branch-prediction gain! It is important to understand that branch misprediction doesn't slow down programs. The cost of a missed prediction is just as if branch prediction didn't exist and you waited for the evaluation of the expression to decide what code to run (further explanation in the next paragraph). if (expression) { \/\/ Run 1 } else { \/\/ Run 2 } Whenever there's an if-else \\ switch statement, the expression has to be evaluated to determine which block should be executed. In the assembly code generated by the compiler, conditional branch instructions are inserted. A branch instruction can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order (i.e. if the expression is false, the program skips the code of the if block) depending on some condition, which is the expression evaluation in our case. That being said, the compiler tries to predict the outcome prior to it being actually evaluated. It will fetch instructions from the if block, and if the expression turns out to be true, then wonderful! We gained the time it took to evaluate it and made progress in the code; if not then we are running the wrong code, the pipeline is flushed, and the correct block is run.

{"comment_text":"On ARM, there is no branch needed, because every instruction has a 4-bit condition field, which tests (at zero cost) any of 16 different different conditions that may arise in the Processor Status Register, and if the condition on an instruction is false, the instruction is skipped. This eliminates the need for short branches, and there would be no branch prediction hit for this algorithm. Therefore, the sorted version of this algorithm would run slower than the unsorted version on ARM, because of the extra overhead of sorting. The inner loop for this algorithm would look something like the following in ARM assembly language: MOV R0, #0 \/\/ R0 = sum = 0 MOV R1, #0 \/\/ R1 = c = 0 ADR R2, data \/\/ R2 = addr of data array (put this instruction outside outer loop) .inner_loop \/\/ Inner loop branch label LDRB R3, [R2, R1] \/\/ R3 = data[c] CMP R3, #128 \/\/ compare R3 to 128 ADDGE R0, R0, R3 \/\/ if R3 >= 128, then sum += data[c] -- no branch needed! ADD R1, R1, #1 \/\/ c++ CMP R1, #arraySize \/\/ compare c to arraySize BLT inner_loop \/\/ Branch to inner_loop if c < arraySize But this is actually part of a bigger picture: CMP opcodes always update the status bits in the Processor Status Register (PSR), because that is their purpose, but most other instructions do not touch the PSR unless you add an optional S suffix to the instruction, specifying that the PSR should be updated based on the result of the instruction. Just like the 4-bit condition suffix, being able to execute instructions without affecting the PSR is a mechanism that reduces the need for branches on ARM, and also facilitates out of order dispatch at the hardware level , because after performing some operation X that updates the status bits, subsequently (or in parallel) you can do a bunch of other work that explicitly should not affect (or be affected by) the status bits, then you can test the state of the status bits set earlier by X. The condition testing field and the optional \"set status bit\" field can be combined, for example: ADD R1, R2, R3 performs R1 = R2 + R3 without updating any status bits. ADDGE R1, R2, R3 performs the same operation only if a previous instruction that affected the status bits resulted in a Greater than or Equal condition. ADDS R1, R2, R3 performs the addition and then updates the N , Z , C and V flags in the Processor Status Register based on whether the result was Negative, Zero, Carried (for unsigned addition), or oVerflowed (for signed addition). ADDSGE R1, R2, R3 performs the addition only if the GE test is true, and then subsequently updates the status bits based on the result of the addition. Most processor architectures do not have this ability to specify whether or not the status bits should be updated for a given operation, which can necessitate writing additional code to save and later restore status bits, or may require additional branches, or may limit the processor's out of order execution efficiency: one of the side effects of most CPU instruction set architectures forcibly updating status bits after most instructions is that it is much harder to tease apart which instructions can be run in parallel without interfering with each other. Updating status bits has side effects, therefore has a linearizing effect on code. ARM's ability to mix and match branch-free condition testing on any instruction with the option to either update or not update the status bits after any instruction is extremely powerful, for both assembly language programmers and compilers, and produces very efficient code. When you don't have to branch, you can avoid the time cost of flushing the pipeline for what would otherwise be short branches, and you can avoid the design complexity of many forms of speculative evalution. The performance impact of the initial naive imlementations of the mitigations for many recently discovered processor vulnerabilities (Spectre etc.) shows you just how much the performance of modern processors depends upon complex speculative evaluation logic. With a short pipeline and the dramatically reduced need for branching, ARM just doesn't need to rely on speculative evaluation as much as CISC processors. (Of course high-end ARM implementations do include speculative evaluation, but it's a smaller part of the performance story.) If you have ever wondered why ARM has been so phenomenally successful, the brilliant effectiveness and interplay of these two mechanisms (combined with another mechanism that lets you \"barrel shift\" left or right one of the two arguments of any arithmetic operator or offset memory access operator at zero additional cost) are a big part of the story, because they are some of the greatest sources of the ARM architecture's efficiency. The brilliance of the original designers of the ARM ISA back in 1983, Steve Furber and Roger (now Sophie) Wilson, cannot be overstated.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11227809\/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":4965,"word_len":827,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Sorted arrays are processed faster than an unsorted array, due to a phenomena called branch prediction. The branch predictor is a digital circuit (in computer architecture) trying to predict which way a branch will go, improving the flow in the instruction pipeline. The circuit\/computer predicts the next step and executes it. Making a wrong prediction leads to going back to the previous step, and executing with another prediction. Assuming the prediction is correct, the code will continue to the next step. A wrong prediction results in repeating the same step, until a correct prediction occurs. The answer to your question is very simple. In an unsorted array, the computer makes multiple predictions, leading to an increased chance of errors. Whereas, in a sorted array, the computer makes fewer predictions, reducing the chance of errors. Making more predictions requires more time.

{"comment_text":"Bjarne Stroustrup's Answer to this question: That sounds like an interview question. Is it true? How would you know? It is a bad idea to answer questions about efficiency without first doing some measurements, so it is important to know how to measure. So, I tried with a vector of a million integers and got: Already sorted 32995 milliseconds Shuffled 125944 milliseconds Already sorted 18610 milliseconds Shuffled 133304 milliseconds Already sorted 17942 milliseconds Shuffled 107858 milliseconds I ran that a few times to be sure. Yes, the phenomenon is real. My key code was: void run(vector<int>& v, const string& label) { auto t0 = system_clock::now(); sort(v.begin(), v.end()); auto t1 = system_clock::now(); cout << label << duration_cast<microseconds>(t1 \u2014 t0).count() << \" milliseconds\\n\"; } void tst() { vector<int> v(1'000'000); iota(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); run(v, \"already sorted \"); std::shuffle(v.begin(), v.end(), std::mt19937{ std::random_device{}() }); run(v, \"shuffled \"); } At least the phenomenon is real with this compiler, standard library, and optimizer settings. Different implementations can and do give different answers. In fact, someone did do a more systematic study (a quick web search will find it) and most implementations show that effect. One reason is branch prediction: the key operation in the sort algorithm is \u201cif(v[i] < pivot]) \u2026\u201d or equivalent. For a sorted sequence that test is always true whereas, for a random sequence, the branch chosen varies randomly. Another reason is that when the vector is already sorted, we never need to move elements to their correct position. The effect of these little details is the factor of five or six that we saw. Quicksort (and sorting in general) is a complex study that has attracted some of the greatest minds of computer science. A good sort function is a result of both choosing a good algorithm and paying attention to hardware performance in its implementation.

{"comment_text":"An answer for quick and simple understanding (read the others for more details) This concept is called branch prediction Branch prediction is an optimization technique that predicts the path the code will take before it is known with certainty. This is important because during the code execution, the machine prefetches several code statements and stores them in the pipeline. The problem arises in conditional branching, where there are two possible paths or parts of the code that can be executed. When the prediction was true, the optimization technique worked out. When the prediction was false, to explain it in a simple way, the code statement stored in the pipeline gets proved wrong and the actual code has to be completely reloaded, which takes up a lot of time. As common sense suggests, predictions of something sorted are way more accurate than predictions of something unsorted. branch prediction visualisation: sorted unsorted","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11227809","post_title":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11227809\/why-is-my-function-returning-none","timestamp":"2012-06-27T13:51:36","char_len":961,"word_len":150,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don't know how it works. But it's actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I'll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit. Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files. (F) A-B-C \u2191 master Option 1: git reset --hard You want to destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes . You do this: git reset --hard HEAD~1 The result is: (F) A-B \u2191 master Now B is the HEAD. Because you used --hard , your files are reset to their state at commit B. Option 2: git reset Maybe commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off. You want to undo the commit but keep your changes for a bit of editing before you do a better commit. Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD: (F) A-B-C \u2191 master Do this, leaving off the --hard : git reset HEAD~1 In this case the result is: (F) A-B-C \u2191 master In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit. When you do a git reset HEAD~1 , you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit. But (unless you use --hard ) you leave your files as they were. So now git status shows the changes you had checked into C. You haven't lost a thing! Option 3: git reset --soft For the lightest touch, you can even undo your commit but leave your files and your index : git reset --soft HEAD~1 This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your index alone. When you do git status , you'll see that the same files are in the index as before. In fact, right after this command, you could do git commit and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had. Option 4: you did git reset --hard and need to get that code back One more thing: Suppose you destroy a commit as in the first example, but then discover you needed it after all ? Tough luck, right? Nope, there's still a way to get it back. Type this git reflog and you'll see a list of (partial) commit SHAs (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in. Find the commit you destroyed, and do this: git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed You've now resurrected that commit.

{"comment_text":"To help clarify this madness, I'd like to begin by apologizing on behalf of all Android users for Google's downright ridiculous treatment of the soft keyboard. The reason there are so many answers, each different, for the same simple question is that this API, like many others in Android, is horribly designed. I can think of no polite way to state it. I want to hide the keyboard. I expect to provide Android with the following statement: Keyboard.hide() . The end. Thank you very much. But Android has a problem. You must use the InputMethodManager to hide the keyboard. OK, fine, this is Android's API to the keyboard. BUT! You are required to have a Context in order to get access to the IMM. Now we have a problem. I may want to hide the keyboard from a static or utility class that has no use or need for any Context . or And FAR worse, the IMM requires that you specify what View (or even worse, what Window ) you want to hide the keyboard FROM. This is what makes hiding the keyboard so challenging. Dear Google: When I'm looking up the recipe for a cake, there is no RecipeProvider on Earth that would refuse to provide me with the recipe unless I first answer WHO the cake will be eaten by AND where it will be eaten!! This sad story ends with the ugly truth: to hide the Android keyboard, you will be required to provide 2 forms of identification: a Context and either a View or a Window . I have created a static utility method that can do the job VERY solidly, provided you call it from an Activity . public static void hideKeyboard(Activity activity) { InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) activity.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE); \/\/Find the currently focused view, so we can grab the correct window token from it. View view = activity.getCurrentFocus(); \/\/If no view currently has focus, create a new one, just so we can grab a window token from it if (view == null) { view = new View(activity); } imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), 0); } Be aware that this utility method ONLY works when called from an Activity ! The above method calls getCurrentFocus of the target Activity to fetch the proper window token. But suppose you want to hide the keyboard from an EditText hosted in a DialogFragment ? You can't use the method above for that: hideKeyboard(getActivity()); \/\/won't work This won't work because you'll be passing a reference to the Fragment 's host Activity , which will have no focused control while the Fragment is shown! Wow! So, for hiding the keyboard from fragments, I resort to the lower-level, more common, and uglier: public static void hideKeyboardFrom(Context context, View view) { InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) context.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE); imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), 0); } Below is some additional information gleaned from more time wasted chasing this solution: About windowSoftInputMode There's yet another point of contention to be aware of. By default, Android will automatically assign initial focus to the first EditText or focusable control in your Activity . It naturally follows that the InputMethod (typically the soft keyboard) will respond to the focus event by showing itself. The windowSoftInputMode attribute in AndroidManifest.xml , when set to stateAlwaysHidden , instructs the keyboard to ignore this automatically-assigned initial focus. <activity android:name=\".MyActivity\" android:windowSoftInputMode=\"stateAlwaysHidden\"\/> Almost unbelievably, it appears to do nothing to prevent the keyboard from opening when you touch the control (unless focusable=\"false\" and\/or focusableInTouchMode=\"false\" are assigned to the control). Apparently, the windowSoftInputMode setting applies only to automatic focus events, not to focus events triggered by touch events. Therefore, stateAlwaysHidden is VERY poorly named indeed. It should perhaps be called ignoreInitialFocus instead. UPDATE: More ways to get a window token If there is no focused view (e.g. can happen if you just changed fragments), there are other views that will supply a useful window token. These are alternatives for the above code if (view == null) view = new View(activity); These don't refer explicitly to your activity. Inside a fragment class: view = getView().getRootView().getWindowToken(); Given a fragment fragment as a parameter: view = fragment.getView().getRootView().getWindowToken(); Starting from your content body: view = findViewById(android.R.id.content).getRootView().getWindowToken(); UPDATE 2: Clear focus to avoid showing keyboard again if you open the app from the background Add this line to the end of the method: view.clearFocus();","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"1109022","post_title":"How can I close\/hide the Android soft keyboard programmatically?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/1109022\/how-can-i-close-hide-the-android-soft-keyboard-programmatically","timestamp":"2009-07-10T11:27:17","char_len":4861,"word_len":715,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I have spent more than two days working through all of the solutions posted in the thread and have found them lacking in one way or another. My exact requirement is to have a button that will with 100% reliability show or hide the on screen keyboard. When the keyboard is in its hidden state is should not re-appear, no matter what input fields the user clicks on. When it is in its visible state the keyboard should not disappear no matter what buttons the user clicks. This needs to work on Android 2.2+ all the way up to the latest devices. You can see a working implementation of this in my app clean RPN . After testing many of the suggested answers on a number of different phones (including froyo and gingerbread devices) it became apparent that android apps can reliably: Temporarily hide the keyboard. It will re-appear again when a user focuses a new text field. Show the keyboard when an activity starts and set a flag on the activity indicating that they keyboard should always be visible. This flag can only be set when an activity is initialising. Mark an activity to never show or allow the use of the keyboard. This flag can only be set when an activity is initialising. For me, temporarily hiding the keyboard is not enough. On some devices it will re-appear as soon as a new text field is focused. As my app uses multiple text fields on one page, focusing a new text field will cause the hidden keyboard to pop back up again. Unfortunately item 2 and 3 on the list only work reliability when an activity is being started. Once the activity has become visible you cannot permanently hide or show the keyboard. The trick is to actually restart your activity when the user presses the keyboard toggle button. In my app when the user presses on the toggle keyboard button, the following code runs: private void toggleKeyboard(){ if(keypadPager.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE){ Intent i = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class); i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION); Bundle state = new Bundle(); onSaveInstanceState(state); state.putBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD, true); i.putExtras(state); startActivity(i); } else{ Intent i = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class); i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION); Bundle state = new Bundle(); onSaveInstanceState(state); state.putBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD, false); i.putExtras(state); startActivity(i); } } This causes the current activity to have its state saved into a Bundle, and then the activity is started, passing through an boolean which indicates if the keyboard should be shown or hidden. Inside the onCreate method the following code is run: if(bundle.getBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD)){ ((InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE)).showSoftInput(newEquationText,0); getWindow().setSoftInputMode(LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE); } else{ getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM); } If the soft keyboard should be shown, then the InputMethodManager is told to show the keyboard and the window is instructed to make the soft input always visible. If the soft keyboard should be hidden then the WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM is set. This approach works reliably on all devices I have tested on - from a 4 year old HTC phone running android 2.2 up to a nexus 7 running 4.2.2. The only disadvantage with this approach is you need to be careful with handling the back button. As my app essentially only has one screen (its a calculator) I can override onBackPressed() and return to the devices home screen.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"1109022","post_title":"How can I close\/hide the Android soft keyboard programmatically?","post_url":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/1109022\/how-can-i-close-hide-the-android-soft-keyboard-programmatically","timestamp":"2009-07-10T11:27:17","char_len":3800,"word_len":530,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"In my dealings with businesses and people in general, I find that sometimes the most tactful approach is also the most direct. Instead of asking, \"Why are there so few reviews?\"--which feels like a grilling--ask instead, \"Where might we see the earlier reviews?\" If you are writing an email or letter, you might say something like the following: Where may we see reviews of the your earlier weddings? We found the reviews on your website for the most recent weddings but we were unable to find any going back more than three months. On your website at (list URL of specific page) you say you have been professionally photographing weddings for ten years. If you could direct us to those earlier reviews, we'd appreciate it very much. A telephone conversation might be similar except you might have to use the title of the page instead of the URL regarding the location of his statement about having been in this profession for ten years. Mentioning the ten years in a non-accusatory manner is vital because: It is the key issue upon which your concern is raised. It catches him off-balance and forces him to account for the missing information. His response will either: a. Give you the location of the missing reviews. or b. Try to distract you from wanting to see them. The reason it usually works to present the situation this way is that it assumes he is an honest and genuine businessman, which allows him to retain his dignity. An honest businessman will apologize for having failed to link to his archived material, or wherever it is, and eagerly make it available to you as potential customers. On the other hand, if he is not a genuine honest businessman, he will have to lie about those missing reviews. Some common ways of \"lying\" are to respond as though he were being grilled. For example, if he gets defensive or angry and\/or makes you out as being indecently \"checking him out,\" he is almost certainly running a scam. If he senses that you are a hard case to win, he might even link you to fake \"reviews.\" There is no telling how creative he will be. However, your fiance's concerns about offending him are probably misplaced. If he's honest, he will be apologetic and helpful; if not he will be tense and probably offended no matter how polite and tactful you are.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"24175","post_title":"How to ask potential wedding photographer about low number of reviews","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/24175","timestamp":"2020-02-20T05:01:08","char_len":2308,"word_len":403,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"In short : don't demand your girlfriend goes on birth control, but have a discussion about it. I waited until I became sexually active to go on birth control. I wasn't comfortable playing with my hormones like that, but using condoms did get tedious after a while and I decided I'd rather use a contraceptive. With my doctor, we decided on one which met my needs. This was all my decision, from start to finish. I'm a pretty laid back person, but if my boyfriend at the time had said \"isn't it time you start using the pill ?\", I would have gotten angry. (Not saying that's how you were going to talk to your girlfriend, but I'm feeling a sprinkle of entitlement in your post that would not go over well, I imagine.) You can absolutely share your worries, but I wouldn't demand anything of her. There are several reasons for that : Her body, her choice Using a contraceptive is a deeply personal decision. So first, don't expect your girlfriend to use a contraception. It is a possibility that you wish to discuss, but don't go in there thinking she should do it. Second, don't suggest yourself what kind of contraceptive would be appropriate for your girlfriend. If she agrees to use a contraceptive, she gets to decide what would be better for her. Depending on her needs, any medical issues, side effects... this is a decision she gets to make, preferably with her doctor. You can voice a preference, what you would be more comfortable with, but that's it. Since women being on birth control has become a \"normal\" part of life, I think too many people think it's not a big deal (and thus, asking your girlfriend to do this is ok) and ignore how much pain\/hassle\/stress\/... can go into that. If you feel so inclined, here are some resources on what going on birth control can entail : Vox - why isn't birth control better The Guardian - It's time for men to step up and share responsibility for birth control Buzzfeed - Men take \"birth control pills\" for a month You can do (a bit) more First, I want to address the reason why you want her to use a contraceptive : your fear she'll get pregnant, which may be irrational. You say there have been \"isolated\" signs of her being pregnant. Since you don't mention what those are, I can't really get more specific, but a lot of signs of pregnancy also occur for other reasons. So are you just afraid she'll get pregnant because she's not on a birth control (and it's a first for you, you're not used to it, your mind sees things or interprets stuff in a weird way), or are there other reasons ? Digging a bit there might help you find a better solution. Plus, if my partner wanted to talk about me possibly going on birth control (or modify my body in another way), the more he can explain the why, the more sympathetic I would be. Also, you seem to think that female birth control is the only way to ensure no pregnancies. First, may I remind you that no contraceptive is 100% reliable ( Planned Parenthood has a great website for this). And also, there's more you, the guy, can do. Sadly the man pill is still not a reality, so your options are quite limited, but they're there and I think being informed about them and truly considering them will allow you to have a more wholesome discussion with your girlfriend. Condoms with spermicide, which increases the condom's effectiveness The pull out method (only when combined with the condom though !) And if you plan to not have children at all, a vasectomy : very effective, very little risks of complications or side effects (way less than a contraceptive has for women) Again, I understand that the options for you are limited, there's quite a bit of hassle there or you just don't want to \"mess\" with your own body. I just hope that you in turn will understand your girlfriend's reluctance to do the same and show some sympathy. Have a discussion With all this information in mind, I hope you can have an open-minded and constructive talk with your girlfriend. Since you've already talked about contraception at the start of your relationship (kudos for that !), and she wasn't completely closed to the idea, I think this will go well as long as you don't go in there demanding she goes on the pill or get an implant. Explain your concerns, and ask her if she has given any more thought to going on birth control and if she would consider it more seriously now. As for the ban on sex until all is secure, depending on several factors (the time to get an appointment, some birth controls can only be started on a specific moment of your cycle, some again aren't effective immediately and have a waiting period), this could range from a week to a month. I understand if you're uncomfortable with penetrative sex until a solution has been found and put in place. But there's a lot you can do still ! No need to put a ban on sex all-together, just the part where pregnancy is possible. Hands, oral, buy toys, get a bit creative,... Or use the combo condoms\/spermicide\/pull-out method. I think this will go over much better with your girlfriend then just saying \"I'm not touching you for the next two weeks\". Last side-note : don't know what your finances are (and hers) or who pays for condoms, but consider paying for half of her birth control.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"21040","post_title":"I want to bring up birth control to my girlfriend without causing a fight","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/21040","timestamp":"2019-02-19T20:04:19","char_len":5292,"word_len":952,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Let's take a quick look at your situation as I understand it: You previously discussed usage of female contraceptives without angry responses. You're worried that you might get your girlfriend pregnant. You think that abstinence from sex will irritate your girlfriend. Alright, so you're worried that you might get your girlfriend pregnant and that while waiting for her contraceptives to come in, she'll conjure up a huge attitude of anger because she can't have sex. For any normal\/healthy relationship, I really don't expect this to happen. If she understands and sympathizes with your additional worries\/fears she'll be willing to wait a bit. If she does for some reason decide to respond with anger and forms a temper simply because she can't have sex with you for a few days, this is going to raise a red flag. Why? Because she\u2019d be ignoring your own personal wishes and concerns and that brings the possibility for a controlling and just overall bad relationship. She should be attentive to your worries and not simply throw a fit because she has to wait a relatively small amount of time. From what you've told us, it looks like she's generally fine with female contraceptives. Just ask her about it like you did before and mention that it'll make you feel better about things if you waited a few days. Personally, given the well known and documented success rate of condoms when used properly , I think that your reasoning is somewhat fallible and you should consider the idea that just using them until she gets her contraceptives will be okay. :)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"21040","post_title":"I want to bring up birth control to my girlfriend without causing a fight","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/21040","timestamp":"2019-02-19T20:04:19","char_len":1582,"word_len":266,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I'm dog-friendly dog-lover old chap, but as much as I love to see a well-educated dog, I can fully understand people who fear them, and bad behaviours inducted by poor owners. Is there anything you can do without annoying the neighborhood? If you think about enforcing the law and\/or asking the community or condo\/neighborhood board of owners\/users, forget about it. You'll get nowhere past a few disapproving stares (at best) and some vehement rejection (or worse). You're one against a full bunch of people who enjoy what they're doing. They'll probably win and you'll be blacklisted. Is there something different you can do without annoying the neighborhood? I think so. I've had to deal with family members or acquaintances whose fear of dogs was out of this world. This, you can't easily wipe it out. And it would require time you and they don't have. What you could do, is explain your fears and count on their parental sense of responsability. They have kids, as you do. They can understand what you both feel. They would also protect their kids and help them overcome their fears. You ask for their help as a community and as parents , you don't start and fight them with rules to enforce. You don't ask them not to do , which is usually the best way to upset the whole neighborhood. You ask them for help. Starting this way, you'll not make any ennemy. In my case, what I've done was to set up some \"dog-free\" areas and time. So that the dogs would still be free to do things, walk, run and train. And, at the same time, they would do it far from the scared persons. It was either dog-time (20%) or human-being-time (80%). And that's what I'll recommend here. First, talk to a couple of parents. Explain the problem, focusing on your kids. Don't say what you think of dogs (consider them dangerous and dirty), don't blame the owners or the dogs, unless you want to ruin every future move. Say what you'd love to be able to do: share space and time. And carefully explain why: my kids and I are scared and I need to help them. I need to figure out a way to walk down the park with them feeling safe. How could we achieve that? Could you eventually help? It has to look like small talk with neighbours. Then let the word spread around (because dog owners often talk when they meet, and any dog-related topic will rise) and wait a little to see if there's any improvement. Work around a solution that involves a small area that would be dog-free at specific times, or a schedule where dogs would have to be under leash. Like: every day, from 05:00 PM to 06:00 PM : no dogs in the upper left corner of the park. Or dogs can be unleashed only after 08:00 PM. Anything that would give each side some freedom and safety. I'm still doing that when I want to \" break the rules \" in our park. I go when no one's around but other dog owners who walk or train their dog. Never do that with kids around. Never do that when people you don't know picnic. Respect goes both ways, but they'll never understand or have a chance to help\/comply if you don't communicate with them. Be as diplomatic as possible when you explain your needs, and why you'd like to share time and space. If there's a board of neighbours, with a monthly\/quarterly meeting, it would be good to take the opportunity to explain. No accusatory tone. From your comments, it seems like you don't know how to approach some dog owners and need a conversation trigger. I would just stop by two\/three of them sitting on a bench and\/or talking while watching the kids\/dogs play, and ask a simple question like: \" Hi folks, I see that some kids and free dogs are playing around. My children and I are really afraid of dogs, do you know of any place around this park\/neighborhood where we could go? Is this place always crowded with dogs running freely? Any better time to walk around here? We're new here so we're kind of lost. \" You don't blame them for their dogs or attitude.

{"comment_text":"There are two problems: Dog mess and fear of dogs. Everyone hates dog mess, including most dog owners. The good news is that everyone hates it and you don\u2019t have to do anything. Others will. Imagine you see a dog doing his business. You say to the owner \u201cyou should pick this up\u201d. They say \u201cI forgot to bring a poo bag\u201d. You know they are lying, and they know you know they are lying, and don\u2019t care. Nothing you can do without a major confrontation. As a dog owner, I always carried spare poo bags. So I tell them \u201clooks like you forgot your poo bag, but I\u2019ve got one for you\u201d. Now it is 100 times more difficult for them to refuse to pick it up without being obviously and very blatantly rude. So lots of people are in a much better position than you to solve this problem for you. The other thing is fear of dogs. Trying to force your opinion on others will make you unpopular, succeeding will make you more unpopular. The best thing to do is to learn about dogs. There\u2019s a small number that you shouldn\u2019t get to close too. For example, a Chow Chow is fiercely protective of their family. Stay away, they are fine. Look like a threat to their family, they will defend their family. But most dogs, if you run away, it\u2019s a game to them. Throw a ball, they bark and go after it. You run away, same thing. So you need training against the phobia so you don\u2019t run away, and they will be fine. Now phobias are hard. That can need a professional to help. Or you can talk to the owner of some small to medium size dog, and let them introduce you to the dog. 95% of dog owners will only be too happy to help (wear old clothing that you don\u2019t mind getting dirty). There are three dogs where I found that kind of introduction necessary. Two white boxers, over four stone (30kg) each. They know me, they run towards me to play, they get a big hug, and they are good as gold. And the other is an English bulldog, over 20kg, and slobbering. A phobia would make that problematic. And remember that if you do something against the phobia, that will help you for life. Dogs that you should fear are very very rare. And you would observe other people avoiding them if there are any. Still, avoid them, don\u2019t run away. (Tip from a professional: Walk away at a 90 degree angle. That tells the dog you are boring and uninteresting. Never had to try this). PS. Bringing a knife or pepper spray is a very bad idea. In the very unlikely case that you run into a dangerous dog, these will not stop him, they will make him angry. And you don\u2019t want an angry dangerous dog. In addition it will make the dog owner very angry, and if they call the police instead of taking direct action, you are in trouble. PPS. A few days ago I met a German Shepherd. He seemed to act quite aggressively. It turns out (according to the owner) that he had been mistreated as a young dog and was terribly afraid of any strangers. Following her advice, I bent down to him, talked to him very friendly, crawled his chin, and he was absolutely happy and friendly within two seconds. PPPS: To keep yourself and your children safe (safer) you could look at a free online course at https:\/\/www.dogstrust.org.uk\/dog-advice\/life-with-your-dog\/at-home\/dog-and-child-safety . This tells you and your children how to recognise what a dog is up to, so you can act appropriately not to annoy it, recognise when it is annoyed and stop what you are doing, and recognise when there is a bad problem and walk away from it safely. So this keeps both you and the dog happier and safer. There are limits, like someone pointing a gun at you and demanding your wallet, nothing you could learn here will help. But your chances of you and your kids being hurt will be reduced.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28250","post_title":"How do I convince my neighbors to not bring dogs in public space without a significant negative effect?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28250","timestamp":"2023-04-27T05:49:19","char_len":3738,"word_len":693,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"From a communication point of view, your main problem is excusing yourself and giving an challenge-able explanation, while at the same time acknowledging that other solutions exist. As a person with High-functioning autism, I noticed a lot of(if not all) people have some type of behaviour that's similar or identical Your cinema example is a good way to show HOW NOT TO do that. First, you don't have to explain yourself. Let's go to cinema Y. That's a statement. Plain, simple. The reason why you want Y? It doesn't matter. People have myriad reasons to do things A way, while other would think B is better. Because it smells funny, the cashier looked at me wrong way, you need to turn left instead of right when exiting, they have the wrong kind of butter, my friend once ate there and got food poisoning. This is why I think many people show behaviour similar to autism but it's accepted because it's not explained and excused with autism . Being overloaded with sounds is the same as \"Can you turn radio down?\". Too many people being close to me or rubbing against me is the same as \"I like to go shopping on Wednesday because there are less people\". It's just worded differently. The outcome is the same. If you envision any challenge to, or questioning of, your statement, you can back it with some type of solution. Let's go to cinema Y, we can take my car. Now, if there is any opposition, it would be on the same level as your discomfort. Because that is what it boils down to - discomfort. And when both sides are on the same level, the discussion can commence. If you tell everything at the beginning, you are starting from worst starting point. You're already at the discomfort, that the other side doesn't feel it (yet). Compare it to people sitting. One decides to stand saying \"I prefer to stand\". Their preference, their choice. But if they said \"I will stand because I have hemorrhoids,\" people would joke about it. Some might offer a cushion or a better chair because it was shown as a problem. And problems need solutions. A problems itself can be challenged, \"Does it really exist in the first place?\". Challenging a statement is much harder because the challenger need to bring arguments against it. You give an argument against in your request. Try to think without explaining yourself with autism. Many things are \"socially acceptable\" if you don't give the opportunity to deny their source. Just show the outcome.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":2480,"word_len":430,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Please note that I am not autistic. My experience is tertiary from my brother who was diagnosed with Asperger's, now High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder, and how we handled sensory issues and other people for him. Your requests seem very valid and well worded, but the issue is the other person's protestations to your requests. The other party seems to dismiss your requests because they misunderstand the issue. I think that the sensory issues that sometimes accompany autism are not understood at all by the general public so people don't get that these aren't just minor inconveniences, but are, at best, extremely bothersome or painful at worst. People understand that autism = \"social issues\" (whatever that may look like) or melting down because those are more visible. So when people argue your issues, they see \"Strong scents induce headaches for me\" and \"I'm extremely fond of physical space.\" not \"Strong scents keep me from functioning well\" and \"Touching others makes my skin crawl and I cannot process anything else until the touching stops.\" So refute back: Me: I'm so sorry, your aftershave is causing some sensory issues for me. I've actually got autism and I've got trouble with some strong smells. I would really appreciate if you could tone it down a little in the future. Them: Oh, I get a headache from strong smells too sometimes. A painkiller usually solves it. Me: It's not just a headache, when a scent is too strong I feel [insert sensory overload sensations here] My brother, diagnosed when autism was getting more into the spotlight, had sensory issues that we just didn't quite understand. He couldn't wear certain clothes and we gave it the term \"nubby\" as in \"These jeans feel nubby.\" He was still pretty young and had to make up our own vocabulary. That one was pretty simple, but we had to teach people (and I had to learn myself too) that startling my brother caused physical pain. It got to the point where we would just state matter-of-fact that when one does X, my brother feels pain. Sometimes it worked. Other times it worked after several explanations\/reminders (I was in this category). And sometimes people wouldn't own up to it nor apologize. The last group eventually lead to us leaving our church once.

{"comment_text":"Reiterate that the core issue is related to the autism, and that as a result \"standard\" fixes are not effective. Also consider pointing out that you, too, are trying to minimize your own stress and inconvenience. My experience with autism is also second-hand (relatives and acquaintances with autism, not myself). But I do have OCD and there are a lot of similar situations, as my brain processes information about the environment around me in ways that I know others around me do not. What I have found most useful in those situations is to: Remind the other person (or people) that I have OCD Express that the OCD causes me to perceive and experience things that others do not Acknowledge any inconveniences that arise from tending to my OCD-derived needs Mention (gently) that I also experience a great deal of inconvenience and trouble as a result of dealing with the OCD (it's not just, or even primarily, an issue for the people around me), and to that end I am already trying to achieve the smoothest, easiest result that keeps the OCD manageable Most people do not invest a whole lot of time or effort into examining their preferences or needs in the way that would be necessary to appreciate what something like autism or OCD is like. They legitimately don't understand how something which they can deal with so casually might be more of an issue for a different person. Often the closest they get is imagining a spoiled, neurotypical child who demands that things be their way because that happens to be how they already want it and they stubbornly will refuse anything else. That that analogy isn't a good one is not something a random person is likely to internalize and understand on their own. In a case like that, casual, low-detail reminders that you have autism may backfire. When people don't understand what the experience of having and managing autism is like, or your personal experience of autism, it can seem like the person making that claim is treating it as a magic word to get their way on small, arbitrary issues. A comment like I don't like touching, you know. Autistic -smile-. presumes that the person you're speaking with understands the increased sensitivity to touch common to autism (and\/or any other features of the condition that are relevant for you, specifically). If they do not understand this , then this is the opposite of both an explanation and an argument for why your preference should be chosen. You can't make someone else behave respectfully or well, but you can try to correct the mistakes which prevent them from understanding what's going on. When someone says something like: Me: I'm so sorry, your aftershave is causing some sensory issues for me. I've actually got autism and I've got trouble with some strong smells. I would really appreciate if you could tone it down a little in the future. Them: Oh, I get a headache from strong smells too sometimes. A painkiller usually solves it. they are clearly revealing where the breakdown in information and understanding is, and that is knowledge you can use. The other person in this scenario obviously doesn't appreciate how having autism differs from their own experience, evidenced by their commiseration (my reaction to strong smells is a lot like yours) and their \"solution\" which applies to their own situation but not at all to yours. Your response can correct those errors, even though they can't force real understanding in the other person: You: I appreciate the suggestion, but it's not a matter of getting a headache. One of the things that's common with autism is a massively heightened sensitivity to some sensory inputs, like smell. Your aftershave is probably a normal amount with a normal smell (I haven't heard anyone else complain about it), but because of my autism I perceive it a lot more intensely. I experience it more like having Old Spice blasted into each nostril with a firehose, and it can be really difficult for me to focus on anything else while that's going on. I'm sorry, and I'm not blaming you for anything, you didn't do anything wrong or bad, I personally just can't work effectively when I'm around smells that I experience that way. Please believe me, if I could take an Advil and then not have to deal with anything like that, I would. In a heartbeat. But there is no pill for autism-related heightened sensitivity to smells. I made up quite a few details just to fill out an example explanation (like the firehose nostril bit), but the core elements should work regardless of the specific details: no one has done anything wrong, there is simply a situation which no one can change that imposes some extra considerations. If you can describe the consequences of the accommodation not being made for you, that can also help. This won't always produce the results you want-- some people just aren't accommodating, or can't make the accommodations you want, or other possible issues. But if you can, in a calm and straightforward way, clearly express the precise issue you have (not being able to be around strong smells, etc.) and emphasize that the issue is due to an inflexible obstacle (autism), you will give the necessary information to the person that needs it to understand the situation correctly. Other things can help persuade people to try to accommodate you, particularly if you offer suggestions to help meet your needs in a low-impact way or offset the inconvenience to others (a great example of this in the question was offering to drive to the further theater), but I believe that the major problem you're encountering is simply that most people don't know very much about autism and don't understand that accommodations might be needed, or what those accommodations might involve.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":5816,"word_len":981,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Frame challenge: Why do you link those two? (the diagnosis and the problem) That you have problems with strong smells is a problem that can be dealt with separately. I have a position where I regularly train people in conflict resolution, coaching, problem solving and communication. Part of that curriculum are some small \"rules-of-thumb\" that is generally applicable. 1: Problems should be defined as singular and close ended as possible. So if you can construct 1 problem as 2 problems, you will find them easier to solve as separate. 2: Be careful of how you communicate - there are multiple semi-councious styles or ways of communicating that direct how people should respond. If you make a causual claim because this then that, and therefore you should do X - you will find it more likely to be challenged - because you argue something. Most people wish to convey the rationale behind their thinking, to seem more reasonable to others, and it is a gentle and sympathic thing to want - but: when adding reasons and causual relationships you open up for argument. Even when the intention is not to invite argument. What you want to do, is avoid the Argumentative Mode When you are presenting something in that mode, you are opening the argumentative door. (Use the expositive mode instead) Example : \"I like my car, because it is red\" - can be challenged ( \"That's not a proper reason to like a car\" ) - but \"I like my car\" is likely to go unchallenged. When you attach your problem or issue to a diagnosis, you open up for the challenge (unfair or no, ignorant or not) that the issue can or cannot be caused by such a diagnosis. The easiest is to remove that rationale and stay with the problem -> inform your coworkers about your problem - not your rationale of the problem. Suggestion \"Hey, Joe, your aftershave is causing me discomfort, I have trouble with strong smells - do you think you could for my sake go easy on it in the future? I'd really appreciate it\" \"I didn't think that joke was funny - autism is a serious diagnosis to those who have it\" \"Sure, I'd love to see it, but do you mind if we go to Cinema X?\" You may of course at a different point of time apologize for asking for these concessions, maybe even buy your coworkers some sweets or cake or something and say that you assume it can be challenging to have a coworker that has these issues and that you appreciate them for being understanding. This would probably increase the chance that your requests get fulfilled successfully.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":2542,"word_len":449,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Giving feedback to someone about the fact they smell can be a bit tricky. That's why I won't talk about that in my answer, especially since Lux Claridge's one do that very well. I'm on the autism spectrum too and I also have anxiety issues. Before I do something, I need it to be planned in advance. For example, if you want me to drive a car, I need to know at least one week before. If my parents want me to visit them, they have to ask (at least) two weeks before. If it's my cousin, it's one week (because she lives closer and it's easier to go to her place). Those restrictions are here because, otherwise, my anxiety would be unbearable. Just the idea of having to take a decision in such \"short notice\" is making my anxiety skyrocket. Like you, at first, people didn't really care (or didn't trusted) that this was causing me so much anxiety. So they keep doing what they were doing with anybody else and asked me stuff within short notice. Since I didn't want to displeasure them, I almost always said \"yes\". But saying those \"yes\" costs me much. I was then very stressed, feeling like I wasn't ready to do whatever activity I agreed to do and mostly didn't enjoy myself while doing those supposedly \"fun\" things. So, at one point, I decided that this had gone on for long enough. If people weren't capable of respecting me, by asking in advance, I wasn't going to say \"yes\" anymore. Thereby, the next time my mother called and proposed I go visit them in three (!) days, I told her: Mom, if you want me to come, you need to ask me at least two weeks in advance. This is too much stress for me otherwise. I won't come. I had to do that with every person who was asking me stuff not enough in advance. And it worked out great. I did have to re-iterate my will to my cousin (she asked me four days in advance, I told her it wasn't enough) but it wasn't a big deal and my cousin apologized for the stress she caused me. So, to answer your actual question: I think, at some point, you have to draw a line. If being able to sit comfortably is important enough for you (and I have the feeling it probably is), then you might want to decide to stop going to the other theater altogether (or decide on what circumstances you are ok with it, and on what you aren't). This will help demonstrate to people how important this is for you which, in return, will help you see your desires\/needs respected. I used this same technic for other things where people weren't taking me seriously and it always helped.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":2550,"word_len":473,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Like you, I am on the autism spectrum, and I'm somewhere in the range of what has historically been called Asperger's. There are multiple ways to address this problem that can be used depending on whether you do it in the moment or before the moment ever arises. I don't have as much experience with asking people to accommodate my needs in the moment, but I do have a few techniques that I've developed to help me mitigate such issues before they arise. Before the moment arises Explain how autism affects you As I've written about in this answer and that one , just knowing that you have autism does not always help people understand you. Because autism encompasses such a large range of conditions, it's quite difficult for someone to understand your specific experience of autism without more in depth explanation. To combat this, when I tell people that I have autism, I explain very specifically ways that it affects me. For example, I am highly sensitive to foods, and therefore am a very picky eater. When I tell people about this, I like to explain what eating different foods does to me (I like to use the metaphor of a blown fuse in a circuit). For someone you interact with a lot like a family member or close friend, you can explain at any point what autism is like for you. Be specific and give examples of times when something has overloaded you. Talk about what you had to do to get work through the overstimulation. I have found that when I explain this in the natural course of conversation, others are usually more cognizant of things that could affect me in the future, and on the occasions that they are not, I can very quickly mention it and they are happy to accommodate. Have an advocate My personal favorite way to get others to accommodate my autism is to have a 3rd party get involved. There are a few reasons why this is useful. The primary one is that sometimes when you need an accommodation, you are unable to ask for it. When that is the case, having someone else ask for you can be extremely helpful. The second reason (which has been the case far more often for me) is that it's easier for someone to accept that you need accommodation and provide it if they see someone else doing it first (this concept is known as social proof ). I have a lot of sensory issues related to the sense of taste, so when I need accommodation, it's usually in the form of finding food that won't overload me. I've had a lot of conflict with coworkers over where to eat for team lunches because they want to try some place that is interesting to them, but I wouldn't be able to eat anything on the menu. I explained my frustrations one day to one of my teammates, and then she began to push the team towards being better about accommodating my autism. After she started advocating for me, my needs were considered more often, and without as much conflict as they had been before.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":2914,"word_len":530,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Being autistic myself, I have embraced it as a slightly humorous, nerdish persona; people (correctly) don't feel they understand what autism is like, but they are comfortable with the idea of nerds - being a nerd is mildly cool, somehow. Nerds come in all walks of life, usually being people who are very good at concentrating on subjects, if they aren't disturbed, and often nearly obsessive with specialised subjects; for me it is mathematics (category theory, if you must know - I can bore most people to tears), but it may be anything. So, tell people you're a nerd, and they are more likely to accept that there are things about you they don't understand - and don't need to understand; they just need to accept it, really. Edit So, examples - I'm not too sure about this, actually; you see, being what I am is just natural from my point of view. I have lived more than 60 years now, and I have developed from embracing loneliness to learning to accept and sometimes even enjoy social contact, but slowly; I still find it very hard work going to a party - there are just too many things going on, and nobody who who would be interested in talking about things I find immensely fascinating. My exact ways of coping with life are not universally relevant - autists are probably more diverse than most, the reason being that what I for lack of a better word call \"normal people\" have a natural tendency to be like others, follow fashion etc, whereas autists most often don't become part of the flock - so we diverge. However, I think there is a core of shared experience, and the divergence happens as a result of whichever interests we pick up along the way. I grew up hearing a lot of Danish, working class humour with quite rough edges, and one thing I have learned to use with some success is humour - and \"nerdishness\" is a form of humour, I think - and I think autists more often than the average have a wild imagination; I personally have had to rein that in a lot, because otherwise people simply don't know what I'm talking about. As an example, a colleague once came to my desk, looking a bit thoughtful; my attempt at being funny was \"Ah, you've come to gloat, have you?\" - I think I had just read some funny story about conspiracies, but he looked absolutely stricken. Of course he had no way of understanding my context, and I still feel bad about it. Now, I would probably have said something more like \"You look worried - how can I depress you further?\" - I think that might work; I have found that injecting a bit of consideration for others in what I say often helps. I think what I have found most useful is my own brand of absurd humour (as long as I don't go over the edge); often plays on words, often stating obvious nonsense as Absolute Truth, and with great authority. An example of the first would be something like \"Are you finished? No, I'm Danish\", of the latter things like \"Have you got any morals? Good heavens, man, what are you talking about - of course not!\" or \"Do you like children? Mmm, yes\". As I said, I was marked by my childhood. Finally, why do I think \"embracing your inner nerd\" is a good idea, at least if you have autism? Well, firstly it is about accepting what you are - being autistic, you are not likely to be the life of the party, but you probably have an immense capacity for learning - not just within one's own, narrow obsession, but just about any subject - and enjoying it. Most things can be learned, and interpersonal skills are, well, just skills, which can be learned, even if it comes hard. Secondly, there seems to be a trend at the moment for \"nerd cool\" - I don't understand what that is about, but lack of knowledge has never stopped people in the past; so you might as well reap the benefit. Nerd chique is of course just a shallow fashion, but you are the real thing.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":3857,"word_len":711,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"The issue is, you're approaching what is effectively non-negotiable criterion in a negotiating mindset. You're saying to the person 'I have issue XYZ, can we do this?', and naturally the person will negotiate and offer solutions, even if those solutions are undesirable. If there is only one solution you prefer, you need to offer the social version of a Hobson's choice . So, assuming someone asks if you want to go to the cinema, your response would be: I'd love to go to the cinema, however, due to my condition, there is only one cinema I can go to. Don't worry if you're not able to go there, I just won't be able to attend. Effectively, you're framing the choice as a binary option: we can either go here, or I won't be able to attend. For dietary issues at restaurants, for example, I'd express that I can attend, 'just I won't be able to eat'. By reframing it as 'either we go here or I can't do X', it's no longer about social negotiation but social restrictions, the other cinema excludes you from enjoying the film, and thus your only valid options are XYZ. If the person disputes that, then it boils down to whether it's a valid place for you to attend or if you have to politely decline attendance.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23171","post_title":"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23171","timestamp":"2019-10-15T11:58:02","char_len":1224,"word_len":222,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"The most important thing is that people know you are autistic.

I can give you some tips. You are showing a bit of a transactional attitude, you've been giving her things and she's not giving you things back. This is literal things (chocolates, stuffed animals) in some cases and metaphorical ones (smiles, glances) in others. How about you stop giving her things. Look at her because you enjoy looking at her. Smile because seeing her cheers you up. Say something nice because you like saying nice things. There is no score or tally here. She doesn't owe you something back for these. She may also enjoy looking at you, be cheered up when she sees you, like saying nice things and in that lucky circumstance the two of you will echo each other pretty frequently.

As a side effect, there's a nice young woman there who you might be drawn to, and who might even be drawn to you. Don't let the side effect run the day. Accept that you don't know how she feels at the moment. Also understand (as I think you do) that how she feels is a malleable thing that can change for the better and for the worse based on how you behave to her. Now, how can you actually woo her instead of trying to find out if she already likes you? More smiles, more compliments such as \"I like that necklace\/scarf\/bookbag\", or \"I liked that question you asked about [whatever]\", more conversation starters like \"what an interesting diagram that was!\" after class. (This one can lead to you walking somewhere together chattering away about this subject you're both learning. That can be so much fun!) Don't make the only thing you want to hear from her be whether or not she's interested in you. Talk about this thing you have in common (the class) and see what else you end up learning about each other.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28969","post_title":"Confused About Signals with a Girl","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28969","timestamp":"2025-03-22T23:57:21","char_len":2389,"word_len":437,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"For someone who doesn't pick up quickly on social cues, and doesn't really understand hints to react appropriately to it, polite and direct communication is often the best way to reach them. So you shouldn't shy from being assertive here. But remember that assertiveness isn't about getting your way - especially in an inter-personal situation. It is about trying to understand each other, acknowledging the rough edges of each other's personality without judgement and learning to navigate around it to preserve (and perhaps even earn) mutual respect. So one way to approach this situation would be to try and understand why he is disparaging towards you. Instead of just saying, Hey, when you do 'X' I feel 'Y.' Could you maybe change your behavior? ... you could first ask him for clarification - \" When your GF pointed out to you that I was having a bad headache, why exactly did you remark that 'I always have something wrong with me'? Do you really believe that I often act like that to seek attention from others? \". Depending on how the conversation goes, you could also discuss other specific previous incidents when he made disparaging remark against you. You could then also point out to him that these hurt you. To introspect about oneself, through another person's eyes is not easy. Sometimes he may say something critical that may be or may not be valid and genuine and you will automatically feel defensive. Or you may not understand him or he may be uncommunicative. Either way, you will be able to get some idea of whether he is just ignorant, disinterested in learning social skills or in building a stronger friendship with you or just plain mean. You can then make a better decision on what to do next. (My first assumption on reading about the particular incident was that perhaps he got jealous of the attention his gf was giving to you and thus he reacted with a mean remark at you, as a coping mechanism). Ofcourse, all this also depends on what kind of relationship you want with someone and how much effort you want to put into it. Let's face it, it takes time and patience to get to know someone and be comfortable with them while we all grow and change. There is nothing wrong in just taking a step back from an existing relationship that you feel has stagnated due to the other person's unwillingness to change or acknowledge your feelings.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28732","post_title":"How to approach my autistic friend regarding his negative behavior?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28732","timestamp":"2024-06-07T17:31:47","char_len":2387,"word_len":416,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"(Moving my comment to a full-fledged answer) As well as designating someone\/thing, a pointed finger may also be an accusatory gesture. Without any context, the person being pointed at (or people witnessing you pointing at people) might believe you\u2019re accusing instead of designating, and being accused is widely felt as defaming (however justified or not. The \"Il n\u2019y a pas de fum\u00e9e sans feu\" effect is in full force here). However, it\u2019s dependant on each person\u2019s sensibility, experience, upbringing, etc. For instance, your coworker didn\u2019t mind the pointing, while your manager did. It is therefore more prudent\/socially acceptable to refrain from pointing unless you\u2019re certain that people around won\u2019t take it as accusatory . Please note that there are different ways to point at people\/things, and they do not convey the same meaning : Pointing straight at someone with a straightened index, closed fingers, and horizontal, straightened arm (from the shoulder) is the most accusatory version of pointing, especially at someone\u2019s face. On the contrary, an open hand, facing up, with bent elbow, gesturing towards someone\u2019s torso is much less accusatory and much more designating (it has a \"For instance, this person\/thing\u2026\" meaning). Also, pointing at inanimate objects is usually fine.

{"comment_text":"Pointing your finger at someone is seen as either an adversarial gesture or threatening one. FWIW: in some Asian cultures, it's insulting, as you only point your finger at an animal. About the adversarial\/threatening gesture: the finger, as shown straight, stiff, pointed towards a person (not an object), is perceived as the symbol of a weapon (knife, lance, gun...). You then become the target. Nowadays, it's more evasive, and includes : accusing, shaming, hating, preaching, patronizing... and so on (the meaning will also depend on the tone you use). Even the iconic painting of Uncle Sam saying \"I want YOU ( for US Army )\" is aggressive. But it was meant to be, challenging, striking the reader. As a kid, you point your finger to show what you want, then to touch a thing and discover things. Later, you keep the attitude to draw attention. But you shouldn't. Keeping the gesture is seen as immature, and aggressive (-> I want to touch you ). As an adult, it's often seen as a very impolite way to interact, as pretty much all aspects of pointing your finger at someone are offensive.

{"comment_text":"why is it that society finds it rude to point at people? What's the harm in doing that? There have been many useful answers. My answer may not be entirely new but I shall try to introduce new factors. Culture Gestures are generally culture-dependent. For example showing the soles of your feet\/shoes is very disrespectful to some cultures and not to others. I discovered this when I had a girlfriend of a different culture to mine. I just had to learn this fact. It did not seem necessary to enquire why. I made sure I did not show the soles of my feet to her or her family. (for example by putting my feet up on a footstool) Britain In Britain, and I suspect many other English-speaking countries, pointing is used mainly to indicate inanimate objects. If I point at a person, there is some implication that I think of them as an object rather than a human-being with thoughts and emotions. Note that there can be more subtle differences. For example, at a party or meeting, it is impolite to point. However if you saw an amazing street-performer, say a juggler or acrobat, then it is acceptable to point to direct a companion's direction of gaze. It is however understood that you are pointing to the activity (throwing juggling balls) rather than at the person. In practice it is difficult to see the difference. If you are speaking to an individual, then the fact you address them as \"you\" is enough for them to know that you are speaking to them and not someone else. Therefore pointing is considered unnecessary as well as impolite.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26102","post_title":"Why is it socially not acceptable to point at someone with your finger?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/26102","timestamp":"2020-09-02T13:01:12","char_len":1556,"word_len":275,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"What's the harm... ? Imagine that you see some people in the distance and somehow you know they are talking about you, but you can't hear what they are saying. I think most people will feel uncomfortable with that. You would want to know what they are discussing. If someone is pointing at you, that suggests that you are the subject of something the pointer is planning to do or that you are the subject of conversation. If you don't know what it is about, this can be annoying. So the fact that the one who is being pointed at does not know why he or she is being pointed at is the main reason it is impolite.

I think most of them are excellent answers, although I don't think the sentiments expressed in those answers are held universally. Because of this I will concentrate on the second part of your question, why it is considered rude to point to people you are talking about (at a party\/social setting). This is because it clearly gives away to everyone present that you are talking about them. Which in turn makes everyone curious what kind of juicy gossip you have about them. This is just not done.

{"comment_text":"Here in germany , children are taught explicitly not to point at people, but there are situations where it is entirely acceptable. My take at this is that it depends mostly on whom you point at: the one you talk with \/to (grammatically: second person) or a third person whom you talk about , and whether there is aggression in the gesture. From your description of the situation, I'd have guessed it acceptable. Rude why is it that society finds it rude to point at people? What's the harm in doing that? The \"3rd person pointing\", i.e., pointing at someone else whom you are talking about with your colleague is frequently considered rude. I'd say that the underlying reason is because gossiping about a third person is rude. So when this pointing gesture is considered a symptom of such gossip, it is likewise considered rude. The 2nd-person pointing (you), as others have pointed out, may be perceived as aggressive. The extreme of this would be to get very close to the one you are talking to (= intruding into their personal space) and actually tapping their chest (= violating their personal space even more). That would be considered the beginning of physical aggression. Acceptable use while I was talking, I was also pointing at them (it was an unconscious way of emphasizing the \"you\" part) Another situation is when someone is far away and surrounded by multiple people. In those instances, I find it really useful to be able to point in order to tell someone else \"here is the person we are looking for\/talking about\". (the person I am pointing may or may not be able to hear what I am saying.) This would be entirely OK in Germany. German sign language uses pointing with the index finger for you . The same gesture is used by many people (even without knowing that it is actually the official sign), e.g. in noisy environments as in your example or in situations where one should not make disruptive noise. Some notes related to autism: You may find environments too noisy to understand other people where others still understand fine. Others thus may not realize that the environment is noisy for you; and you may not know where their too noisy\/not being able to hear&understand starts. If possible, I'd recommend asking the co-worker as well whether they perceived the pointing as rude. Depending on whether your boss and co-workers know about your autism, or whether you are fine with telling them explicitly about particular difficulties you have and what helps you communicating, I'd think it entirely reasonable to let them know that you have difficulty understanding already in moderately noisy environments (if that is the case). In other words, that it may help you if they use more gestures. And that gestures help you communicating, e.g. making unambiguously clear who the you is that you ask to help with the task. You could also try whether you can replace the pointing with the other's name (\"X, could you please do the task\" rather than \"Could you [point] please do the task\").","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26102","post_title":"Why is it socially not acceptable to point at someone with your finger?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/26102","timestamp":"2020-09-02T13:01:12","char_len":3096,"word_len":519,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"You sound like a very nice and practical person to be friends with! Saying no could undermine the friendship. I also ask them for important favors, though never at the last minute. If I say no, they might do the same. If I make excuses, they will, too. This has happened before. Then don't make excuses or give them a reason to say no or excuses. We indians are taught from a young age that relationships have to be prioritised and nurtured in our culture, especially by actions like being there for someone when they need us. But obviously, this can sometimes be very tiring and exhausting. Often, we forget to nurture our self - whether it be through a special interest or a hobby or our career etc. - and prioritise which relationship we want to be in more. All that too matters very much in life. Don't look at it from an \"either this or that\" perspective - you saying no once or twice or many times, doesn't mean that your relationship has to end or that it (ethically) frees the other person from their obligation to help you (despite owing you for past favours). You just have to learn the appropriate skills to deal with their tantrum, anger or hurt feelings when you say no to them. After all, ups and downs are normal in a relationship. Let me give you an example - assume that you are really busy with an important work and one of your relative asks you to help them with something, without warning. You want to really prioritise your own work because it is important. You tell them that their timing is very bad and you are swamped with a lot of work that you cannot put off any longer. When they insist emotionally, you tell them clearly that this time you really cannot help them at this moment but are willing to help them tomorrow or next week. You do not budge, and keep saying no to their pleadings, and they finally get the message. What happens next? They may understand. All, however, will get upset to some degree. But that's ok. All of us know that sometimes life's shitty - either because of our own ineptitude or due to the actions of others or just due to uncontrollable circumstances. It's also natural to get upset when someone says no, even if the 'no' is justified. Some may wrongly just blame you for not being a good relative or friend. Either way, you shouldn't worry about it because you know that you acted with honest intentions, and not with any malice to end your relationship with them. Sometime we do have to put our own need first (once in a while), especially when it is the other person being inconsiderate. Now, if you never meant to end your relationship, what's next? Well, what do you do when someone you know is upset? You try to cheer them up. And that's what you should do, as soon as possible, after you are done attending to your own work \/ life . When you are free, follow up with them on what happened. Find out if they still need help and offer to do so. If they are hurt and standoffish, or angry and rant at you for not helping them when they needed, listen to them and assuage their hurt feelings. Be nice. If necessary, scold them too. If they accuse you of not being there, remind them of all the times you did help them, and tell them it hurts when you accuse them of not being helpful because you couldn't. Don't be afraid to share your feelings appropriately and honestly. My point is, you don't have to cut off the relationship or allow it to die just because someone is upset at you (or is being immature - you be the adult, in that case). Depending on how much you like them, if they are still hurt and angry, do something nice for them - like giving them a small gift or inviting them home for tea or a meal. Helping someone when they need it, and ask for it, obviously does matter in any relationship. But you don't always have to say yes (when you can't) to convey that you value the relationship. Sometimes it means as much to just being in touch consistently with them to share their happiness or sorrow or daily worries. Or even doing a kind gesture, like following up in person to find out how they are or inviting them over when they are emotional or avoiding you - to just remind them that they are not forgotten and are important in your life too. Trust me, this is a more balanced and satisfying way to have a relationship. Just be true to yourself and share your feelings honestly with others to the best of your ability - help those you can depending on how badly they need it, but don't be afraid to prioritise your own needs once in a while. And just learn to deal with upset and emotional people with kindness (and a little tough love) Similarly, do not be afraid to ask for help when you need it, from your friends or family as long as you too understand they have a right to say no, despite whatever favour you have done for them. Some will help, some may not be able to due to their own circumstances. Those who can't help you today, will help you some other time. And some may simply be selfish and not want to help you - with these, there is nothing wrong in reminding them of the past favours you have done them. If they still don't help you, you can stop prioritising your relationship with them. But never stop being kind to them. And yourself.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28710","post_title":"How do I stop my friends &amp; relatives from postponing their requests for help until the last minute and then disrupting my plans with urgent requests?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28710","timestamp":"2024-05-17T23:02:49","char_len":5271,"word_len":983,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"As far as bullying attempts are concerned, in my experience, what works best is to escalate several levels above what the bully expects. Verbal threats usually do not work. Anyone can say anything without it carrying any weight. However, actions matter. Here's an example: My parents own an appartment in a collective ownership building. An inspection resulted in a list of mandatory upgrades we had to do. The property management company sent a 4000\u20ac quote. After a bit of investigation, I found out that only \u20ac1000 out of that was part of the mandatory upgrades, the rest most likely not mandatory, but simply extortion (ie, \u20ac3000 for 3 electric radiators). However, it was impossible to make the property manager say what was mandatory and what was not, most likely because she would get a cut on the extortion, so it was in her interest for me to believe the non-mandatory stuff was actually mandatory. On an old man with cancer who can't leave his home, this legally constitutes \"abuse of weakness\", which is punished by 3 years jail time, a hefty fine, and other goodies. Knowing the manager was trying to extort, therefore an enemy, there was no point in further discussion. So I simply escalated over what they expected. I had the lawyer print out the legislation, write a nice summary ending in \"you have been warned\" and send a registered mail copy to the property manager. Then I sent a copy to everyone, and called everyone in the building to check what kind of stuff they were trying to force them to buy at inflated prices, thereby saving a couple thousand bucks to quite a lot of people who were being extorted too... and killing the manager's business. They simply dropped the ball and pretended nothing had happened, problem solved. So, concerning your \"friend\", here's what I'd do if I were you: If someone doesn't understand on their own that posting pics of someone's mom on a cum tribute site is not something you do, then there's no point in having a polite discussion to convince them of this fact. Especially since you already tried. Most likely, this guy thinks it's funny. It's always like that. There's nothing wrong in being civilized, but that only works on civilized people. So, you should first archive everything: reddit posts, incriminating answers, any mail, text, or voice where he confessed doing it, etc. Several copies, at least two in the cloud, for example MEGA and google drive, on separate storage accounts from your mains. If your mother is getting anonymous phone calls, then it means someone shared her phone number. That goes even further past the red line than publishing the photos. If you don't want the cops to get involved, IMHO you're being way too merciful. The anonymous phone calls could be explained in different ways. First, EXIF tags with GPS coordinates added by the phone to photos. Facebook is supposed to strip those. Second, someone using a reverse image search on the photo to find your mother's public profile, then getting the name. Third, your \"friend\" actually sharing the name, location, or phone number. It is quite important you figure out why she's getting those phone calls, because if the address or name was leaked, someone could show up uninvited. So you can make him confess that he did it via text message. If he already confessed via text, this is ideal. But you need evidence to link the anonymous reddit account and the guy in question. Back up everything and make several copies. Then you can simply show him that you have all the evidence. Basically, don't make threats, instead simply make statements, like \"You posted the photo, I have all the evidence you did, and now my mother receives anonymous phone calls, what do you plan to do about it before we call the cops.\" Simple as that. Wait for a reaction and act accordingly. It would be better to do this by text, or he could try to take the phone and delete the messages. If he doesn't get it, involve your mother, who will most likely send the evidence to his parents. At this point, something should happen that will make him understand.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"27815","post_title":"My classmate is sharing pictures of my mom without her knowledge.

{"comment_text":"When I was a kid, and was facing an unexpected situation or issue, and didn't know what to do, I would always ask\/tell my parents. That's what I was taught, and their explanation was crystal clear: \" there's more in two brains than one, and elders have more experience they can share with the younger people \". That doesn't mean you're wrong and that they know better, it just means you can get help and then you make a wiser decision. Because they've probably faced it before. Or know people better. Or think a couple of moves ahead because of their experience. They more than often have a much more broader and clearer view. Maybe you missed some parameters and they'll take them into account. In my case, my Dad would always help me tune my thinking by asking questions. What do you think? What would you do? What will happen if you do that? Or do this? How do you think the other person will react? And so on... If I was lost, or uncertain, he would just advice and say what he'd do or recommend. He would hit the target 99%. That's what I'm going to do with you, because it's the best thing that ever happened to me, and that helped me so much afterwards: I'll advice you to tell your Mom exactly what you were told, what you've witnessed, what you think about the situation, and ask for her wisdom. Not only she's the one involved, so it's better be her decision, but you should not have to deal with such a situation at your age. Was this happening to you, I would recommend exactly the same. Parents (should) take care of their children, help them grow, and are the ones who should deal with such a touchy situation. Just make sure you share your thoughts and fears, and what outcome you'd prefer. Especially if you want to \"protect\" your friend, despite him doing such a bad and wrong thing. My last advice would be to tell her the truth. Don't lie or say only parts of what you know.

{"comment_text":"With time, I learnt that, when it comes to feelings, love, sex (non-exhaustive list), the truth of the moment might be different from the one of yesterday or tomorrow. Now, if I reorganize your sentences, this is how I read things: Now, I would like to find some \"advanced\" actions that she does like. In the heat of the moment, I also sometimes did a few things that I had never asked her about beforehand. She not only seemed to enjoy them, but occasionally asks me to repeat them for her As is, it seems to me that you already have a communication channel open. She may not be open to talk about pleasure and sex, as many people are not, by culture, education or personality. As a generality, in the heat and darkness of the night (by time and light), some persons are more prone to doing\/exploring things. Like in any other moment in life, body language is important. Except that, in this case, you may have the privacy of some darkness, which makes things easier for some people. So, why wouldn't the both of you talk with your bodies? Slowly doing things, delicately moving hands, there are so many things you can do and that your partner can let do or not by just adjusting her body with a slight move. You'll quickly understand if that move is preventing or accepting your move. But, if your partner isn't talking to you because of shyness, you'll have to understand her body language and pick up the slighest move in order to adjust your own body language. I agree that it takes a lot more time than if you could talk before.

{"comment_text":"I'll omit the shpeel about how to escalate the matter, since that has been covered in other answers. You can certainly do that, but if she threatens to call security as a threat and the individual calls her bluff and no one comes to escort them out, that's only going to make them feel more powerful. I would only flaunt security threats if they can be followed through. One method I've seen others use that has been handy is to have a manager or coworker on board to assist targets of harassment. Here's an example: *Mary is at the register when a customer approaches her *Customer starts making inappropriate remarks that make Mary feel very uncomfortable *Mary calmly signals a coworker who is aware of the harassment she receives (if verbal cues are necessary, asking a coworker \"Bob, could you take over this register for me for a moment? I need to take care of something in the back\" can be effective) *The coworker takes Mary's place at the register (or whatever other duty she is performing), and Mary goes to the back of the store (or some other off-limits to customer) location until the individual leaves The key in this situation is for Mary to not give the customer the time of day. Do not indulge them. The role swapping with another coworker should be done calmly and naturally, as if it would be happening even if the customer were not being impolite. My experience is that it's important to have a team looking out for you, and to take care of each other when you can. Telling the individuals at fault that \"they're being inappropriate\" is exciting for them. They want you to want them to leave. They want to feel like they're in power over you. Having you tell them to stop, and not being able to follow up on having them removed by the police, only empowers their behavior because they're getting away with it. It's much safer to have coworkers that will have her back, and I think she should talk to the people she often works shifts with about doing such. Edit: I also just wanted to add in that calmly and promptly removing yourself from the situation without acknowledging them or showing any fear of them isn't as much fun for them, and they are less likely to return to do it again.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"8738","post_title":"Dealing with sexual comments from customers","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/8738","timestamp":"2018-01-04T06:00:32","char_len":2228,"word_len":400,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Firstly, it is great that your friend realises that there are some cases where it is necessary to leave and seek the manager\/police. However, for the times that she would choose otherwise, I would say that telling the customer to stop that kind of behaviour is the appropriate customer service way to deal with this. Your concern about it feeling wrong for her to have to deal with it and walk away is most certainly valid. It is her workplace and nobody should be required to accept harassment. That being said, there are plenty of wrong ways to deal with customers like this. I have worked in a restaurant and med-tech position both occasionally dealing with customers. From this I learnt (and I think its a common understanding) that as an employee, we do not have to just accept this, but when dealing with it, we should try to do it in a professional way that is not going to damage your or the businesses reputation. So the goal of her response to a customer like this is to get them to stop their behaviour while minimising the risk of them storming out\/getting upset as your friend remains calm and professional. To do this it is important that her response focuses on the behaviour that was exhibited, and not the offender themselves. Focusing on this makes it less personal and so they will be less likely to feel attacked. A simple: Please refrain from using comments like that with the staff at X is one example of a response that tells the customer that the comment was not okay, but also is shutting down the interaction as quickly as possible with (relatively) low risk of escalation.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"8738","post_title":"Dealing with sexual comments from customers","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/8738","timestamp":"2018-01-04T06:00:32","char_len":1617,"word_len":286,"lang":"en"}

Psychologically, this technique aims at stimulating self-corrective processes occurring when a mismatch of behavior and context comes into awareness - shame. In contrast to calling out the behavior (\u201cThis is a sexist remark!\u201d) or defining the person by this behavior (\u201ccreepy pig!\u201d), this technique tends to create less resistance and leave a door open for returning to normal.

So, be wary of how much you push. Think carefully which of these behaviours are ones you have to change, and which ones you want to change. The standard advise for communication is to focus on the present and your feelings. Unfortunately, this often clouds the issue and makes finding mutual understanding and a solution to the current issue less likely, and makes the whole discussion more taxing and even confusing. Try not to bring up past hurts or other topics. Stay focused on the present, your feelings, understanding one another, and finding a solution. So, you could say for example. \"When you don't clean your teeth and don't wash, your breath and body smells and I don't want to kiss you. Please could you clean your teeth regularly and wash with soap, because I find you sexy and want to be with you.\" You should listen to her carefully. If she's depressed, it may be too much effort for her to brush her teeth regularly or shower regularly. As such, you could get her an electric toothbrush, which makes brushing easier, or run her a bath. If it hurts her to not fart, you could help her to the toilet more often. She may well have reasons for her actions you can aid with. Edit. A guide on talking. \"When you pick your nose and eat your boogers in front of me, it makes me feel a bit disgusted and put off, and that drives me away from you.\" This was your suggested way of phrasing it. Some notes. She's not making you feel anything. She can't control your emotions. Be careful when talking about feelings not to blame the other person for your feelings. Say something like \"When you pick your nose in front of me and eat your boogers, I feel disgusted.\" She's not driving you away. Don't blame her for your own behaviour when you talk to her. You're a grown up adult, you can do whatever you want to do including stay or leave. Talk about your feelings, not about how she is forcing you to do actions, unless she is physically forcing you. Try to be a bit positive initially. Rather than using negative words like disgusted say \"I want to spend time with you less.\" and add positive things like \"I'll want to cuddle you more if you avoid that.\"","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"27174","post_title":"Dealing with a depressed partner with personal hygiene issues","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/27174","timestamp":"2021-07-25T01:15:11","char_len":3166,"word_len":496,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"First, I paraphrase my interpretation of your question (the crux): \"My colleagues and I do creative but technical work. Our solutions can be correct or incorrect, but there are multiple tradeoffs and stylistic factors which confound the determination of what is 'best'. Nevertheless, consistency enables scale, and we are suffering from a lack of it. How to improve the situation without exacerbating tensions, demotivating team members and wasting time on meta work?\" Blockquote Second, I will declare my personal bias. My opinion is that creative output is maximised when all (or at least the most productive) staff members feel that: They have autonomy over implementation details that they care about. Directions they receive are the outcome of a negotiation between them and their boss\/client. And that conversation begins with sharing the end goal. The first of these \"requirements\" can conflict with standardisation (e.g. coding to a pattern). But not necessarily. And if the second goes awry, you can lose productivity to an indecisive democracy. You mentioned that a key issue is maintainability. Why do you care? It's good for the business. But it could also be good for morale. That's where you need to focus. Now for the hard part... how? How can you get the team to agree? You probably can't do it in a series of abstract meetings. You are unlikely to achieve it with an abstract methodology. I recommend that you encourage dialogue about specific challenges. Look for small problem domains where consensus can be found, or instruction is clearly needed, where immediate improvement can be realised, within the normal flow of work. Be strategic about who you involve when you embark on this unsolicited quest. Obviously don't engage the least confident members of the team in an open discussion about flaws in their work. If the workplace is relaxed and informal, you might be able to introduce an element of humour to lubricate the conversation. Finding improvements could be fun. On the other hand, one needs to be realistic about what they are dealing with. If you work in a proverbial graveyard, then I would not suggest any attempts at improvement. Save yourself. I can picture a developer working late on a Friday evening, cursing their colleague for \"thwarting them again!\" This isn't the ideal time for coding, nor for dealing with stress. I doubt it's very funny in the moment. However, most of us can tolerate a few mistakes from our colleagues, provided it doesn't become a pattern. If people are bottling it up and getting serially frustrated with particular individuals, or circular conversations that achieve nothing because they attempt to solve everything, then the business will eventually become toxic, or lose good staff \"unexpectedly\". Yet if team members feel comfortable discussing issues with each other - and especially if they can laugh about it afterwards - then these problems will resolve themselves. I have found my most successful collaborations were with people who were impervious to embarrassment. That is the key emotion you must not invoke. Though approach it from the other direction, by making people feel comfortable. You can lead by example. You can make fun of yourself, or invent fictitious situations in which some work of yours bamboozled your colleagues. When it's make-believe, the more ridiculous the better. Though I haven't done anything so contrived (I usually try to inject humour \"in the moment\"), you could start some suitably frivolous code golf in a group chat. By such means, you can be amusing without the time pressure. Be aware that anything can be taken the wrong way by anyone, but without risk there is no reward. One can always find ways around a difficult crowd, to get them feeling good about solving a problem. And you really must pitch a good invitation; nothing will happen if you don't. The best work is done voluntarily. I do not recommend setting a goal of arriving at a standard for best practice. Rather, I would aim to foster a forgiving, commitment-free, ongoing conversation around improving the consistency of future work. If the conversation is light hearted, interesting, and well intentioned, then it will gain its own momentum and eventually inertia (the good kind). You can always document whatever is agreed, but - even then - I advise giving each idea time to prove its merits before carving anything in stone. Agreeable people can agree on anything, but when the rubber hits the road... For example, you have probably (I have) encountered instances of people agreeing on the best object-oriented coding pattern for a specific problem, and then disagreeing on which of the subsequent problems qualify for application of the rule. It's just not usually that simple, since each problem exists within a broader context, and there are many ways to skin that cat. Furthermore, documentation is a burden. People sometimes feel compelled to write documentation, so let them. But you are correct to avoid a time investment until you are confident that the standard will stand the test of time. This will not make you unpopular. When there are strong disagreements on a given topic, and both sides have a point, then maybe leave it alone. Usually there is a line of responsibility. If someone feels strongly, and they are responsible when something goes wrong, then that might be OK, but what if they leave? Some concessions will be needed for redundancy. I often wonder, who will take care of this when I'm gone? Sadly, the answer is that the code better work, because my work tends to be specialised. Whatever the specifics are, no one wants to be working overtime to fix something, and you can win points by encouraging them to develop with that mindset. Everyone wants to go home on time, so you can use that as something to rally around. However, you really want to start with the easy stuff, as even friendly debates (if had in the open) can cast a dark shadow on the entire initiative for conflict-averse people. I myself have engaged in productive debates with colleagues that were evidently \"too intense\" for the onlookers present, who subsequently shied away from related \"learning opportunities\" which others tried to foist on them. So I try to temper even congenial dialogue when it might be intimidating (I mean in a complexity sense) to others present. Revealing too much complexity to the wrong people tends to demotivate them. Make it fun if you can. If there are some big personalities, bring them onboard, and ask them to have a good time with it [not advised in case of graveyard]. But keep it short or entertaining. Discourage long form debate in a group context. Depending on the workplace, collaboration might be what is missing. Perhaps you just need to clearly blur the lines of responsibility when it comes to the maintenance of work. But it's very situation specific. It can also go the other way. Sharing too much responsibility might constrain your star performers. What matters is that people are thinking about each other. How will Ben fare if he has to read my code? Does Sharon have time to teach John how to adhere to this standard? Can we reasonably expect a new hire to be familiar with this pattern? Cultivating an environment where the ease of broad adoption is valued requires...? Actually valuing it. In dollars. That might be unrealistic, so go easy on yourself. Many plans are undermined by sudden changes in priorities, and the agile methodology celebrates its preparedness for this eventuality. But a business that doesn't know what it wants is (usually) not a business that values your time. Colleagues who are resigned to it all being pointless will reasonably curtail their improvement ambitions. Though if there is some stability in the priorities, things can get better. Given the specific context of everyone working from home, developing software, I strongly recommend pair-coding. It's not that much of a boon when the two coders have a large knowledge gap (e.g. when reviewing code one has already written), though it can be very effective when writing a solution to a new problem together. I find it easier to compromise with others when the code hasn't yet been written, although one often finds that what was agreed in the earlier conversation is not practical when the writing begins! Oh well... at least you know where to start the next conversation. In summary, the answer is \"Gradually.\" If you can get people reviewing each other's work in a low-stress, high-value, low-consequence, few-people pattern of intellectual exchange, then problems will solve themselves. Later on, you can record the outcome.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28144","post_title":"How does a single person influence the team towards consensus and a positive change in team culture?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28144","timestamp":"2023-01-22T16:49:28","char_len":8767,"word_len":1437,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I'm regularly offering food to the homeless people I meet in the streets of my city. Experience taught me that it's not such a good idea to buy the food first and then offer it, since it'd be something that the receiver doesn't enjoy consuming \/ is allergic to \/ ... To avoid this situation, I usually come to see them first and tell them: Hi. I have no cash in my purse but I'd really like to offer you something to drink\/eat. What can I buy that you would enjoy? The \"I have no cash\" part is unavoidable in my case because I come from a country where cash is not that common anymore and so I rarely have some in my wallet and buy everything with my card. But I realized with time that this disclaiming sometimes make them more comfortable of the idea of receiving food. The remaining part of the sentence indicates your will to please and they will be more inclined to ask for something they like. This is important because you do not want to look arrogant and if you let them the opportunity to choose what you'll offer, you'll help them the most. You need to know that you may encounter a \"picky\" person sometimes. I offered to buy food to the homeless people in front of a grocery store last year, and they asked me for expensive, raw food (e.g. chopped steak, pork ribs, sausages). I was short on money and couldn't afford to buy them a reasonable quantity of meat, which is quite expensive in my country. You need to know you may find yourself in similar situations oftentimes. However, there are different things you can do to defuse them: When you're offering to buy food, you can give examples of what you can buy them (maybe based on what is sold around): Is there something you would like to drink\/eat? Hot coffee, orange juice, banana, cookies? Not only it can reduce a bit the shame the receiving person could feel to ask you for food, but also could orientate their choice toward one of the foods you've mentioned. In the case they ask you for expensive food \/ food that does not meet your religious and ethical beliefs, you can be straight-forward and tell them. I'm sorry, this is not something I can buy. Perhaps this [similar food] would please you too? You're not obliged to disclaim the reason why you don't want\/can't buy it, but there's nothing wrong to do it either. Keeping it for yourself could spare you a debate but also make you look arrogant. It depends on what is most important to you. The last thing I want to tell you is that if you're willing to, oftentimes the nicest thing you can do to help them is not only buy them some food but discuss a bit with them. They will really enjoy to spend some time with you, ask you about your job, the reason you're in town today. There's so many people who don't even greet them and pretend they're not here, they will really appreciate the human contact and trust me, you'll also learn from it too.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17082","post_title":"Offering free food to random people as a kind gesture, without being condescending or strange","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17082","timestamp":"2018-07-30T03:24:49","char_len":2925,"word_len":535,"lang":"en"}

These sorts of situations can be pretty annoying and, hopefully if you're in the opposite position you'll interrupt your friend at an opportune moment and introduce the unknown party to them but, failing that (as in your situation), you should do this yourself. Hi, friend! I'm anongoodnurse and this is partner. How are you doing this evening? How do you know [friend couple]? [Optional: We were just having a nice discussion of {discussion topic}. Would you care to join us?] Usually making yourself a part of the situation will bring you to their attention as not being willing to sit idly by during a lengthy conversation, which is incredibly rude of them. A quick \"hi\" and \"bye\" is one thing and many people don't interrupt with the intention of a long conversation but by adding yourself to the equation, you make them less likely to ignore you. This will also hopefully give your friends the chance to do their job of saying: \"It's really great to see you but this isn't the best time as we're dining with anongoodnurse and spouse. Let's catch up some other time.\" ... which, as I said, is what the friends should have done in the first place and what we should all try to do if in this situation. Hopefully by being active they'll realize that they're interrupting, which is why the optional part is in there - to make them aware that they've interrupted a conversation - and passively encourage them to realize that they're being rude. This may not work every time but once you've added yourself to the conversation, you can gradually become more pointed in your interruptions encouraging them to move along. Sadly, some people simply can't take a hint and will keep going until they're done regardless. If you feel like you're in this situation because they show no indication of stopping after you introduce yourself, you can use a variation of what your friends should have said to hopefully get them to move on. Yes, it's a bit rude to go this route but sometimes when they're refusing to accept the subtle hints, you've got to either be the carpet for them to walk on or pull it out from under them. I'm sorry to interrupt, friend, but is your interruption going to last much longer? We're trying to have a conversation over dinner but you've been here chatting for five\/ten\/fifteen minutes now.

{"comment_text":"I've been known to be guilty of this kind of intrusion. I have a bad habit of only talking to people I'm closely acquainted with and tend to not address people I don't know well unless they've spoken to me first. In my case I think it may be something of an aspie problem, but I think more introverted people may fall afoul of this kind of behavior. It's probably best to address these situations when they first pop-up, as in when the person fist approaches, with the usual: Hi, I'm SoAndSo addressing the intruder, or Who's your friend? addressing the people you were sitting with. Granted it is rude to bench the other people at the table because someone intruded on a meal, but chances are pretty good that it was unintentional and that the people you were eating with probably didn't expect a 15 minute conversation. I would guess that they were expecting a much shorter \"Hey funny running into you here, good to see you.\" sort of thing. Given that this was at a buffet style restaurant, I'm assuming a more casual enviroment, so it probably wouldn't have been rude to continue eating or indulging in an unrelated conversation with your partner. As far as interrupting the intruder goes... I'm also thinking that this could be an option, assuming an informal setting. Obviously better done at the beginning of the conversation, but like most informal conversations, if there's anything that you pick up on that you can add to, relate to, or generally comment on, feel free to interject. Once you've squeezed a word in edge wise the conversation is a little more likely to open up to the entire table. Again while the intruder is being rude, it's probably unintentional and just a symptom of poor social skills.

{"comment_text":"I think \"Are you alright?\" is a perfectly natural, empathetic, and non-invasive response; we want that person to be alright in spite of what we've just seen. The person probably wants to retain some semblance of dignity. It really covers a multitude of questions: do you think you're ok? Do you think anything is broken? Do you think you could walk? Should I call a doctor? In a CPR situation, when you see someone passed out on the street (obviously not just napping), you're still supposed to shake them and ask loudly, \"Are you OK?\" But if you feel silly asking it, then follow your natural response with a more reasoned one: Are you alright?

About six months ago while chucking balls for my dogs to chase, I misstepped off a curb and fell onto the road, breaking my arm near the wrist. I lay there in the street trying to gather myself together and not cry out (it turns out it was badly broken). Two neighbors who saw this ran over and asked, \"Are you ok?\" It was the most natural thing in the world. I answered, \"I think I broke my arm.\" From there, they got more specific: \"Do you need help getting up?\" \"I'm driving you to the emergency room.\" I won't go into cases where something serious just happened and you should call 911. (If you do want these questions, comment and I'll edit.)

{"comment_text":"TL;DR: in case of an accident, frame yourself in the image of a medical doctor or nurse and do what they would do. \"Social\" things need to step back there a little bit, I feel, until it is clear that there is no life-threatening, urgent medical issue (whether you can actually decide that, as a layman, aside). Also, keep in mind that people in shock are different than normal people; things like light body contact, eye contact, soothing voice etc. might just be more helpful than what words you use, exactly. Imagine yourself as a parent helping a little child (without the hugging\/picking up part...). someone just fell down 8 meters Funny that you should mention that. When bouldering recently, some lone stranger fell and hit her chin on the rock in a hard fall (same effect as a brutal \"upper cut\" in boxing with the complete body weight behind it). It was obvious that it was bad - not necessarily life-threatening, but at least a slight concussion\/whiplash or even some face damage. I think the problem rather is: what do you want to know? You want to know if there is a urgent life-threatening issue first (breathing...); then, whether there is pain involved; then, whether they need help at all. While she lay slightly dazed, I knelt down close to her in a way that she did not need to move her head to see me (but not touching) and did the following: Made sure we had good eye contact and that she was actually aware of me. There was no blood and no obvious damage, she was generally moving, so the worst fears were dispelled quickly. Our eye contact was much more intense than would be appropriate of (different-sex) strangers just meeting on a street, but that was exactly correct at this moment. It was clear that there was fear in here eyes, and it helped her to literally see someone close. If it had been impossible to make eye contact (eyes closed or not reacting), I would probably, depending on the situation, have calmy talked to her while making obvious but very light body contact (like 2-fingers-to-shoulder or whatever was appropriate). Think \"lay on hands\" instead of \"poking\". She obviously smacked her teeth together substantially on the way down and was probably afraid to find out whether teeth (or bits of the tongue...) were missing. I asked her if she was bleeding or there were loose teeth; she said no. I asked her where it hurts, she indicated the general head area, which was expected as she also hit the back of her head when hitting the floor mat. I held her eyes the whole time in a conscious effort to make clear to her that I \"got her\". It was noticeable that that was a good thing as she held the contact as well and was not made (any more) uncomfortable by that. I made sure to talk in an earnest but very calm, unhurried way, also giving her enough time to feel around her own body. This also seemed to work well. I again asked very calmly if she had pain or if something felt wrong\/numb, which likely put her in a state of analyzing the damage instead of being overwhelmed by fear; it prompted her to tell of a brutal headache; but I told her that I see no obvious damage in her mouth (no blood, no obvious teeth damage). And so on (at that point, which took maybe 30-60 seconds, she slowly turned \"normal\" again, the immediate shock went away and other people came as well to help). There are plenty of things you can do and say. I don't even feel that asking \"are you ok\" in lieu of a \"hello\" would have been bad in any way. I would probably tend to use \"are you ok\" if I happen upon somebody in obvious distress where I didn't see what happened, to see if there actually is a problem - in which case the question is not cynical or sarcastic, at all.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"1952","post_title":"What is the correct way of asking &quot;how someone is doing&quot; in case of an accident?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/1952","timestamp":"2017-08-17T13:42:47","char_len":3746,"word_len":680,"lang":"en"}

Things are hard to talk about when we're overly concerned about revealing or requesting to much information, when in fact we all face the same day to day challenges. Be transparent and avoid being intrusive by being mindful of subject matters that have not yet reached that point in your online or personal contact and that are not yet time appropriate.

{"comment_text":"In France (where I am from), there is this social rule that you only give gifts to people who invited you to the celebration (birthday, christening, marriage, etc...) or gave you a gift linked to said celebration. So, basically, gift-giving is for reciprocating something. It's a way to thank someone for spending money or time on you. Furthermore, the value of the gift needs to be related to how much the person spends on you. So, if someone helped you with a small favor, you can reciprocate by giving them a small gift, but it would be considered bad etiquette\/rude to give them something of too much value (because then, they will be the one feeling like they have an obligation toward you ).

Then say something like: I can't wait to have the party so that I can finally give you your gifts! By doing that, your friends will be reassured that you are still planning to give them a gift and that you are simply waiting for the party to do so.

Some even say that it's not the bride and groom's party, but their parents' party - because they often invite work colleagues and trading partners too. Usually, those who don't know the couple (acquaintances of the parents or family) will just give money in an envelope when they attend, or in recent development: bank transfer, or QRIS transfer. This is the most basic ethiquette if one is invited. Those who know may give gifts. However, it is not customary to bring belated gift if you don't attend the party except if you are close. Since you are close to the couple, you should've bring gift as soon as you know they were married. Not as grand as when they host a party, but a token of gesture since you are close . I would've encouraged you to do this before the wedding of your other friends (but it seems this answer is too late) and mention that you forgot to congratulate them and apologize that the gift is not much. This will not pressure them to host their party, but also release you from the obligation of giving bigger gift. It is important to note that you should avoid giving money directly as it's too easy to compare the gift value - although the generation nowadays like it 'mentahnya saja' (literally 'raw' or 'prefer money').","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"25949","post_title":"How to communicate about not giving a wedding gift to friends who haven&#39;t held their party yet?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/25949","timestamp":"2020-07-28T08:18:18","char_len":1505,"word_len":269,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"In your sample conversation, it seems clear to me that \"Person\" didn't ask what you liked about your work in order to find out what you liked about your work. This is why they interrupt your answer - no matter what you answer, they are going to interrupt because they don't care about your answer, they just want to talk. I mostly cut people like this out of my life, but when I do have to spend time with some, I rely on a stock of very short responses that can't be argued with. For example, \"it's fun!\" or \"I'm good at it!\" or even \"More than I could list here!\" These end your turn quickly and let them react or not as they prefer. They can always ask a followup if they truly want to know. This contradicts advice we're often given for interview situations, like repeating the question (\"I like that\") as well as a drive many of us have to be accurate and not exaggerate (\"mostly,\"). You can give those thoughtful and careful kind of answers to people who actually want to hear your answer and care what you say. You can also ignore the question not by standing there silently, but by asking a different one. \"What do you like about your job?\" (an advanced technique is \"oh, you know, so many things, like for example what do you like about your job\".) Or \"how familiar are you with software development?\" Or if you want to flatter them and know something about them, \"I know you're familiar with software development, [pause]\" - in here they can nod and signal you to go on, or launch into a speech if they want. You would be surprised how often people start conversations so they can talk, not because they want to hear what you think.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28921","post_title":"How to pass on a question when you cannot answer efficiently","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28921","timestamp":"2025-01-01T22:19:33","char_len":1654,"word_len":307,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Many people just want to talk, very few want to listen. In social interactions like these, just cut it as short as can be. You don't need them to acknowledge anything you say, you need to \"throw some words in the pot and let it stew\". Imagine the conversation as a recipe. Like any dish, people will like it or not. People put ingredients into the pot, and, if it's smells good, they keep stirring the pot. Otherwise, they stop (read: stop\/move\/leave the conversation). In order to not spoil the stew, as soon as you're interrupted, stop. Ask a question. Ask them to explain themselves. Ask them to develop what they just said. As you can't be the talker, be the listener . The same technic applies if they're picking on you, or denying what you just said. Don't argue. Be evasive, don't give them anything they can chew on. A simple \" well, not much to say about that you know... What about you? \". Any (subtle) variation is good, you must be more resilient that they are. But don't let them come back at you all the time. If they insist, move the conversation to another topic. They'll probably be happy to talk about themselves or anything they like. If you know them enough, move to their ground. If a family member asks about my job, and I don't want (or won't be able to) talk about it, I'll say something like: \" but you seem to do pretty well, how's that?! Market seems to be [whatever] these days. How do you manage to do this? \" With a little practice, this works just fine.

{"comment_text":"I'll give a few practical solutions. Some of these are harder to execute than others, but they assume a relatively low level of existing social skills. The hardest one involves starting to build models of other people's cognition. This is quite difficult, and (in my experience) requires working with only a few people at a time. Start with a stimulus-response \"black box\", and treat your assumptions about why people do things - even the meaning of words! - with very low confidence levels. You need to keep around multiple possible interpretations and goals and meanings for their actions at once, and even open yourself up to the possibility that the person you are talking with doesn't have a single goal, interpretation or meaning for what they are saying, but rather forms back-justifications for their actions after the fact based on further events. Ie, someone could smile at you, and the smile could have different meanings to them based on what happens after the smile occurs. When they smiled, they might not know why they smiled, and their interpretation of the smile can depend on your reaction and the rest of the scenario the smile occurs in. Doing this in real time is extremely hard. But you can look back at past interactions and try to reframe it in this way. Avoid trying to be overly negative (or positive) in your evaluations of meaning and motivation behind actions - instead, but vague and multi-stated . They laughed possibly for a half-dozen reasons at once, not just one reason. They interrupted for a half-dozen reasons. Etc. What more, because the meaning of their actions aren't determined before the action occurs, sometimes you can successfully change the meaning of their actions after they do their action by making the alternative meaning more consistent with their future back-narrative. A crude example of this can be seen with some toddler experiments. You bring out a tin of cookies and ask them what was in the tin. They'll say cookies. You open up the tin and show crayons. If the child is young enough, and you ask them \"when I came in the room, what did you think was in the tin\" they'll say \"crayons\". Why did you say cookies? \"I was trying to trick you\". Their own perceived motivation behind saying \"cookies\" retroactively was rewritten, and they'll steadfastly remember they tried to trick you, because they have no memory of any chain of reasoning behind their original \"cookies\" claim. Instead, they build a justification based on their current state. Lot of people engage in social interaction without doing chains of reasoning to decide on what action they will do at each time. Instead, they are operating on autopilot. The lack of conscious decision making behind their operations means that the reason for their actions is subject to retroactive rewriting - and this is even honest, because the quote real quote reason wasn't even a conscious operation! Practicing this can help prevent reducing other people's motivations too much. Maybe they are interrupting because they don't respect you, but the cause is also going to be a rainbow of other antecedents; and what more, you could possibly retroactively change the cause of the interruption to something else (in their mind) if you make another interpretation more consistent with their future state of mind. Building a decent mental model of another individual like this is a lot of work. Getting the framework to do it in general could take years, and doing it for an individual (especially the first few times) could take months of interaction with them. And then running this model even when you have it ends up being mentally exhausting! But, as an example, doing this to determine \"which gift should I buy person X\" can result in someone being very pleasantly surprised. So that is the hard route. Easier routes can involve learning macros and tricks that reduce the chance of the bad social reaction result. The idea of building up macros - tiny social scripts - is to reduce the amount you have to think during social small talk. Your conscious mind isn't as \"smart\" as your entire brain and definitely isn't as fast; so as we practice certain operations we \"automate\" them out of consciousness. Lookup tables for mathematical operations, driving, walking - these are things we farm out to our non-conscious mind to handle, while our consciousness handles problems that are novel. You'll want a set of low-mental-effort conversational macros you can use to buy time, and ways to prepare and embellish the next macros you are going to use in the conversation. Some low-effort macros include \"turn the question around\", \"make it a joke or pun\", \"talk about it dismissively\", \"acknowledge and change the subject\", \"use a canned response\". Person: \"What do you do again?\" Me: \"I'm a software developer.\" So here, you can give yourself more time to prepare for the conversation by adding \"... and you?\" You don't have to care about what they do. But by throwing the question back at them, you can get them to put more effort into the conversation and buy time for future questions about your job. In addition, their response can provide further \"hooks\" to buy time in the future; whatever they mention, you can tangent back to later on. (Suppose they are a massage therapist; while the conversation proceeds, you can see if your memory pops up any facts or personal things related to that.) Person: \"I bet you don't like that.\" Me: \"I like it.\" This is an example of a conversational dead end. When you respond to someone with something on which the conversation has few remaining threads. The other person in the conversation is likely to flail about looking for a way to prevent the sudden conversational stop: the two options are \"ask you to list and discuss\" and \"ask you to list and dispute what you say\". Imagine you had asked about their job and they provided it. Then this could have been \"I do; how about you?\" - you are under 5 words, and instead of dropping a conversational dead end, you have thrown the ball back into their court. They get to talk about themselves (which most people will do endlessly if prompted) and you get to buy more time. There is a subject on the table that isn't \"are your statements valid\", because now both of you have statements in play. You'll now have a much richer set of things you can \"legitimately\" bring up. You can bring up features about their job, you can bring up things about what they like about their job, you can compare and contrast what you like about your job to what they like about your job, you can even talk about how parts of what they like about their job wouldn't be for you. What more, this entire menu of options can be slid in later in the conversation whenever you don't like the way the conversation is going. Person: \"Oh, really? What do you like about it?\" Me: \"Mostly, I like that--\" [this is where I'd rather pass and not answer] Person: \"I bet it's just about the money.\" Me: \"Nope.\" I mean, \"puzzles\" is a great one-word answer here. \"The quiet\". You are probably going to be asked about your job a large number of times, and the set of questions people probe you on in casual conversation tends to be quite limited. Having a set of stock answers - short and flippant - that can segway into more conversation can save you lots of effort. \"Puzzles, like a jigsaw\" answers quickly and adds another possible subject. \"The quiet; it is too loud in here\" another. Joking answers are also great, because they avoid vulnerable information disclosure, and if an obvious joke they elicit a response and require more thinking on the part of the conversational partner (again, buying time). Playing a conversation as a game of tennis helps a lot here. Each response should attempt to request a response from the other party; even if you don't care, this can buy you time to prepare for your next response, and it turns the conversation from being centered only on you and what you have said (which you don't want, as it could involve challenging your statements validity) to being about things you both say. If the history of the conversation is list of facts you have said, the next topic is either a relationship between those facts, another semi-connected fact, or disagreeing with one of those facts. If the history of the conversation is facts from both parties, then relationships between those facts becomes legitimate next topics to discuss. \"We both like X\", or \"I like X you like Y\" are less disrespectful than \"you are wrong about X\". Instead of catching the conversational lob, send it back with a new spin. Person: \"What do you do again?\" Me: \"Code monkey. You?\" Less serious. Cheap lob back. Person: \"I process health insurance claims. I bet you don't like that?\" Me: \"I enjoy the quiet. You don't?\" Here, their job is also quiet, or at least you can assume it, and you can contrast their experience. You don't answer yes\/no, you skip that step, and instead go to a part you like. Person: \"I bet it's just about the money.\" They interrupt anyhow. Me: \"Ha! What do you like about your job?\" I didn't disagree, I laughed. It is hard to disagree with a laugh, and I don't really want to talk about if my main motivation was money. So I laughed, dismissed it, and tossed a ball back at them. In further parts of this conversation, I can go back to past questions and bring up \"Also, puzzles\" or \"I can work from home\" or whatever as a somewhat valid topic. I can even talk about how the money isn't the motivation if I want, but talking about money is a social mine-field, so I'd probably avoid it. For common topics, having cheap macros ready (I like puzzles, quiet, work from home) ready to spit out is useful. Slightly more expensive macros (How about you? Dismissing a common response. Connecting something you commonly say to something they say \"X is sort of like a puzzle\".) require limited mental load and can be prepared in the background as they respond to your conversational lobs. Now this isn't free - we are talking about listening to their questions and answers while preparing responses and keeping your body language engaged all at the same time. So it requires practice. The lost-mental-cost macros with practice should make the preparing responses cheap enough that you can do it in parallel with them taking their turn. The final thing you can work on is stuff like speaking rhythm, tone, body language, etc. People are probably picking up something from how you speak that makes them think that after 5 words it is their turn to speak. Possibly delay between words is high or irregular, or even an initial delay before responding, or some other detail is inadvertently sending a signal or \"now it is your turn\". If they think they are getting such a signal and you push through, they will get confused, and may not even know why they thought it was their turn. But to them, it feels like you are interrupting them instead of the other way around. Determining what you yourself sound like to others is hard without recording your own conversations or getting a professional to help out. But you could try some hypothesis and see if variations cause better or worse results.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28921","post_title":"How to pass on a question when you cannot answer efficiently","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28921","timestamp":"2025-01-01T22:19:33","char_len":11355,"word_len":1949,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"The problem is that YOU FEEL they only contact you for their own interest - such as when they need something from you. There are 2 situations here: This person would like to see you more times as friends, but because of circumstances this doesn't happen frequently. However, when she needs something, she contacts you even if normally she doesn't because of lack of time - or any other reason. This person doesn't have any interest at all in seeing you as friends and she indeed only wants to get something she needs from you. In the second case, your feeling is completely right: this person is using you, and nobody likes that. In the first case, your feeling is (at least partially) mistaken: this person doesn't intend to use you. In the second case, you shouldn't help this person, since she is not really your friend (even if you thought she was). You don't need to be honest with this person: it is not very polite to say \"I don't want to help you\", even if you have good reasons for it. You can invent some excuses to not help her, like lack of time, or any other. This excuse doesn't need to be a REALLY good excuse, it is enough that the other person doesn't know if you really can't help her or if you don't want to. It is even better if she suspects that you don't want to, because she will stop asking you for favors (if not the first time you refuse to help her, maybe the second or the third). To know if someone is in the first or in the second case, you can try to resume your relationship, trying to see her more frequently. If you see that the other person is still interested in seeing you, you won't have that bad feeling about her asking for your help, because you will know that she's in the first case. If you see that someone is interested in seeing you but you can't because of lack of time, distance, etc. you can choose if you help her or not (you can use the same method written above to refuse), but you will know she's still your friend and you will neither have that bad feeling. If you see that someone is not interested in seeing you nor in being your friend, they're in the second case, so refuse to help her as explained above. EDIT: Other answers suggest to ask for another favor in return. I think this is not the best approach because friends don't make favors just to get another one in return. Because of this, with this method you will stop people who only want to get something for you, but you can make people who is your friend feeling that you only will help them to get something in return, so they will think you are not a good friend. However, they suggest requesting to have a beer or a lunch as examples of the favor you can request in return. This is a good approach, because you are requesting friendship in return, not another favor, which is clearly a fair request. This will also allow you to check who wants to spend some time with you and who doesn't want. What I mean is that saying \"request a favor in return, for example having lunch with her\" includes the possibility to request a different thing in return.

People do grow apart and friendships end, which usually means you're making more time for new relations with other people. Nothing wrong with that. Alternatively they do want to spend more time with you and might just use the favor as an excuse. If you think this is the case and you too want to spend more time together you should just ask them to do something together more often.

It sounds like you could be friends, and hang out, but not on a dating basis. On this basis, inviting the other party to a social setting where they could meet other people, not as going out, but just hanging out might work. This is just a way of learning more about each other, and nothing more. This plays it safe and has no commitments or implications by either party, and is a good way of socially introducing people to your group. Put simply, many relationships grow over time, and there is a lot to get through to know if it is going to work, and you need a safe setting for this to happen or not. Hope this helps","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"13854","post_title":"Gentle way of asking for feedback after the first casual date?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/13854","timestamp":"2018-05-01T08:39:23","char_len":763,"word_len":149,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Unfortunately, dating feedback is almost 100% indirect and\/or nonverbal. If I know a girl really likes being with me, but I don't like being with her, I'm not going to verbalize it, because it's cruelty. You say you're not adept at picking up social cues. I think you're better at it than you are willing to admit. You just don't like what the social cues mean. No one ever needs to wonder after a date whether the other person wants to continue dating. A simple, \"I really enjoyed our time together the other night. I'd like to see you again. How about tomorrow. We can do such and such.\" If the girl is interested in the guy she will say 'yes'. If she has previous plans, she will break them to be with the new guy. If she puts you off, doesn't answer IMs, or is less than enthusiastic, the message is: \"I don't want to hurt you. But ...\" Just picture how you would respond if she said, \"I really like you! Would you like to go out again?\" She wouldn't feel any different hearing that from you, if she likes you. Picture what you would be willing to do given that comment. Would you be willing to cancel your plans to be with her? Would anything stand between you and being with her? If she sent you an IM, would you answer it? She would feel the same as you do if she likes you. People make a decision about others within five minutes of meeting them. So, learn from experience. Your not going to get a line-item feedback list on any date. If you have to ask her, \"It won't hurt me if you don't, but could you please tell me if you like me or not, and if you don't, could you please provide useful feedback to help me on future dates?\" You've blown any possible hope. That's just not the way it works. By being honest with yourself, and making an honest assessment of your appearance, personal hygiene and body language; you can discover areas that might need work. But no date is going to tell you that stuff. Trust me! I have more experience with dating and women than anyone I've ever met, or even heard of. Each date is either the beginning of a lifelong relationship, or it isn't. Those are the only two things that can happen. Before a girl will accept a romantic date (just the guy and the girl) she must entertain the possibility that there is at least some bridegroom potential. Otherwise, she's wasting her time! The guy in order to ask a girl out must also entertain that there is some bride potential. Otherwise, he wouldn't ask her out! A date is a mutual job interview for the position of spouse. Some people might not like that, but it remains the case.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"13854","post_title":"Gentle way of asking for feedback after the first casual date?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/13854","timestamp":"2018-05-01T08:39:23","char_len":2603,"word_len":484,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Don't assume that because you are here on IPS worrying about how to ask if the date went that she is elsewhere worrying about how to tell you she doesn't want another date. Neither of you have talked about it since and your communications are \"dying down\". The way you have described it all sounds pretty even from both sides, so there's a good chance she could be in the same position you are right now - wondering how the date went. Also, I wouldn't worry about being bad at reading social cues. You both met online, you've communicated through messages okay, you enjoyed the date so communication must have continued in the same way on that occasion. I think you should ask her straight out: How did you feel our date went? and Would you want to go on another date? I think this is best for two reasons: You're currently in a position where you feel the date went well, yet still you're left wondering about it. You need some certainty, and so does she. If you use uncertain terms like \"hanging out\" instead of \"date\" then you could be left still wondering. If you don't call it a \"date\" then if she doesn't feel right about a relationship then you have nowhere to back down to. Be direct and then at least you can say \" okay, that's fine, we can still be friends \" and maybe without that pressure she might even want to still hang out as friends. Whereas if she doesn't want another \"date\", asking her to casually \"hang out\" is going to make her wonder if you mean a date.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"13854","post_title":"Gentle way of asking for feedback after the first casual date?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/13854","timestamp":"2018-05-01T08:39:23","char_len":1509,"word_len":277,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I have a couple of different opinions on what you could do. I am dealing with something similar right now at my two daughters' school. We live in a low-income community and the school has been shut down many times. Lastly, there were not enough teachers and not enough buses to take the high schoolers to the only high school they could attend, which is 20 minutes away in the city. The parents had to find them their rides. Can you imagine? Anyway, this is what I suggest... Find out from the school if there is an app or website where parents can stay connected with their child's teacher. Our school used the Class Dojo app, and it listed every kid in their class and that kid's parents' name. On Class Dojo, you could also communicate in a group chat with all the parents and that's an effective way to get their phone numbers or to just find out who they are. I added a lot of parents on Facebook this way. I found a lot of information going on in my town by attending the parent-student body. We would mention issues we had and try to resolve them the best way we could. If we couldn't afford something we would look to the town for sponsors, grants, or fundraising. You mentioned your kid hangs out with some kids from school and you have coffee with them. Mention to them you want to be more involved with what's going on with the parents, teachers, etc. They may know more people and you could have them ask if you could contact them. One of the biggest things you could do is once you get more parents' names and if they want to be involved, you could start a Facebook page. That way you could add the parents you know and in return those parents could add the parents they know. They don't all have to be in the same class or grade. They could be parents of kids who play sports, do chorus or band, or are a part of the school council. Hope some of this helps you because it was hard getting the names of the parents that weren't in my kid's classes because they don't list them on that app Class Dojo. Other parents helped me with that.

{"comment_text":"Sometimes I tell them after they've touched it, but the damage has already been done Ok you know what comes now, tell them before they look at the screen. Like \"here let's look at that on my laptop but please don't touch it as I have to clean it too often\". That is a reasonable reason and telling before doesn't leave them feeling guilty. Annoying things burn into mind more than varying things. If they touch again, say the same phrase again. To make it even more annoying you could take out some towel\/handkerchief and clean the screen before you continue. Say \"It's better to remove it when fresh\" if you like. Of course you shouldn't make yourself too creepy doing so ;-) They should know it's not you to annoy the situation but them.

{"comment_text":"In a touch-screen age, unfortunately you're fighting against a natural and expected behavior. On a display, people expect to be able to point at, activate, and swipe around things with their finger. You can, of course, tell them in advance, \"Please don't touch my screen,\" but this might come across as slightly neurotic behavior, since they may have had no intention of touching your screen. Also (as you have discovered with the developer) they might forget and do it by habit. To counter this, be ready by bringing two objects to every meeting: A piece of paper (any paper) A pointing device (like a pen) Have the paper in one hand. If you see someone about to touch your screen, quickly hold up the paper between their finger and the screen, and say something like Please don't touch the screen, as it leaves marks. Use this (handing them the pointer) instead then move the paper away. Repeat as as necessary. This creates what the Neuro-Linguistic Programming people call a pattern interrupt , basically just a mental trick used to break habitual behaviors by inserting something unexpected into a familiar process. The next time your developer reaches toward your screen he might remember the piece of paper in the way, and stop himself before you need to do anything. This also has the benefit of being non-invasive, in that you don't have to physically touch him or restrain him in any way. You just put up a barrier -- a boundary around your stuff -- so that, even if he touches the screen through the paper, at least it won't leave a mark. Final note: Make sure you get your pointer back, or (better yet) use something you don't mind giving away, something cheap and disposable like a coffee stirrer or a popsicle stick.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17573","post_title":"How can I prevent people from touching my laptop screen with their finger?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17573","timestamp":"2018-08-13T12:27:12","char_len":1780,"word_len":303,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"What I did during my trip to Japan (I spent a week there) was to go to the bathroom whenever I had to blow my nose. Ideally, I tried to wait for a time when there were no other people in there. When that didn't seem likely, I used flushing to mask the sound. When going to the bathroom was not an option (such as on a street), I would at least try to find a secluded area (side street etc.) and be quick about it. I've never noticed anyone visibly reacting to me. In my case, a slightly running nose is pretty much a chronic condition (allergies etc.).

{"comment_text":"Generally, it is OK to simply blow your nose in Japan. Japanese people don't blow their nose because they (especially most men) usually don't carry tissues, and because they can't throw away the tissues readily since there is practically no trash bin available in public. But I just googled it and got pretty surprised to see that some people consider it unpleasant to blow their nose in front of others. It is ridiculous, as keep making an obnoxious noise by constantly sniffling is definitely more unpleasant! But it seems the divided opinion. I would rather like to see the poll by region, gender, and generation... Your friend got the hilarity because of the \"trumpet-like\" sound; hilarity is never close to hostility, so don't mind it. If you care about these naggers, it might be wise to go to a bathroom and blow your nose there. But I believe it goes too far and you don't need to. I also frequently see people blow their nose, especially middle-aged and elderly men but no one around them minds it! (But for some reasons I have rarely seen women do, and in fact the google search got me to know some naysayers dislike the blowing nose only if they are women. Ridiculous...) And some people seem to hate only when they blow their nose while eating, so you shall refrain at the dining if you care about these people. UDPATE There seems to be no poll on the web, but one website asked its readers which of sniffling and blowing is more unpleasant.

{"comment_text":"I live in Germany and ride the Taxi regularly. In Germany: You can sit, wherever you want! When I'm alone I usually sit in the front. A lot of Taxi-drivers are up for a chat, and usually know the city quite well so it can be useful when you are somewhere new. When I have company, I usually sit in the back so we can talk to ourselves. In other parts of the world, sitting in the back seems to be more common or even mandatory (London, New York). In general, you can't go wrong if you sit in the back. Also, if you are a foreigner, there is nothing wrong with just asking the driver on your first ride. I'm new, what's the protocol... Other etiquette for Germany: Tipping is not mandatory, but also not uncommon. Just do however you feel. I usually do ~10%. Prices are fixed by the local government, and there should be a counter that displays the current fare. It has a starting price (~3\u20ac), and then a per km\/minute price. Night rates are usually a little more expensive. That said, especially for longer trips you can often negotiate a cheaper fixed fare beforehand. If there are several taxis, you usually go to the one in the front. Exception: if you want to negotiate a fixed price, you can also ask the other ones. The taxi business is controlled quite tightly. Every taxi has a number in the back window. If you have any complaints, remember that number and the time at which the issue occurred.

{"comment_text":"I rode a taxi once in Germany with a parent of mine, but every taxi drive I took in other countries (mostly western & central Europe \/ China) happened the same way, whether I was alone or not: the driver opens the trunk so you can put your luggage in it and then they either open you the door of the rear of the vehicle or expect you to get in at the rear of the vehicle . I remember one time I had an ankle sprain and no one was home so I had to order a drive to go to class. I got in and sat next to the driver, who was very surprised. I didn't understand at first, but my mother told me later that day that the clients are expected to go at the rear when possible. I don't know if there's an etiquette ruling that but it's more polite to go at rear whenever possible for it lets the driver the choice to engage in a conversation (and release them of the guilt to overhear your conversations with the other passengers if applicable).

{"comment_text":"I had a boyfriend once that had an habit that went against my customes too. This is how I dealt with it. First you don't need to feel guilty, maybe he doesn't care about hygine , which btw doesn't sound like you are an extremist, just pretty standard behavior, while he is on the extreme of uncleaness in the modern world, but you do . THAT is how you are, it is part of your personality. You have the right to decide if it is important for you or not. In my case I had the same problem, I felt maybe I was being too picky. My boyfriend was nice, we got along pretty well. He loved me, and I was willing to lose all that because one thing? Well, even if it is the most stupid thing ever, you have the right to do it. You decide what is important for you . Not someone else. Lets say you let this slide, how are you going to feel in in 2 more years, in 5 years, in 10 years. How are you going to feel when all the other good things may not feel soo good anymore? You are going to feel like you wasted time, like you were stupid for betraying what was important for you, etc.. Think it the other way around, he is willing to push you away because he doesn't want to take a shower and brush his teeth? Is really that much to ask? If it is not important for you, give it up, and start being not clean also. This is clearly not the case. Maybe you 2 are not compatible. I think it was a red flag that he let you clean everything for him and his friends. As your mom said, you are not his mom, you are partners. Where is he partnering in this whole story? And he even let you clean for his friends? I mean I can understand he being lazy, but he wasn't upset that you had to clean and cook for a bunch of other guys? One thing is doing it once in a while, but the way you describe it, it was like a cleaning job without pay. A relationship is a partnership . Expecting everything to go perfect all the time, is unrealistic. But it is also unrealistic to think every single human being is compatible with every other single human being. I know it is sad, but it is the way it is. I don't know if you work and if he works, but depending how much time you guys have available in the day , do you realize it can be considered truly abusive that you have to drive every day 30-40 to cook for him, clean for him and then back to your house where you cook and clean for yourself? I understand if you do it to help him, because he works too many hours and you have more free time. Or because you really like doing it. But you have to be aware that what you are doing there is a lot of work, and he needs to appreciate it. If he can't even be bothered to wash his teeth to kiss you, that is a red flag. Love yourself, who you are, your values, the way you are with other people . You don't have to feel sorry or guilty for asking him to change something that is causing you a lot of distress . From what you describe you have been more than tolerant and if you have fun with him, I would expect that he is having fun with you. You go out of your way to help him. What does he do for you? So, why did I say all of this? Well is so you prepare mentally. You can't go and talk to him like who says \"I am sorry for being soo annoying and picky\". You need to be sure about this. Imagine staying with him for many years without him changing at all, how are you going to feel? Once you made up your mind and feel totally sure about the importance of him changing this you need to have a talk with him. Set a time, without other peope to bother you, have a nice relaxing setting . Make sure you will have time and no one is going to show up and interrupt you. If you decide to do it at night, prepare dinner and before eating you discuss it. If the results are unsatisfactory, you leave and since you already cooked you won't feel guilty he won't have anything to eat. Sit close to him and look at him right in the eyes . It helps if you touch him while you speak, but don't hug him, he is not a child. A light touch here and there or whatever you feel comfortable with. You have to feel close but also there has to be a certain distance. The goal is to make him see you are not judging him, and you love him, and want to be with him . That is why you are sitting close to him. And also that you are serious, that is why you are not smooching . If he tries to derail the conversation getting more phisical stop him. And if he insist leave and tell him you are going to talk more another day. He needs to see you are serious. Then you say something like (lets say he is called John): John, I love you, I enjoy spending time with you and I want to keep doing it. And I think you feel the same for me. Here is better if he doesn't interrupt, but if he wants to say he does or so. It is ok. There is something that is really important for me, I think you know what I mean. I understand you and I are different, you are more relaxed in certain things and your job makes you get dirty way more than mine does. I understand that you can't arrive home squeaky clean. I understand you have some work clothes that are probably going to be not as clean as I would like it. I truly understand and respect that. Is important that you don't judge him, he is the way he is, he also has a right to be that way . It is his decision, it is not your place to judge him or change him. That is why you shouldn't say things like \"you have a problem with hygine\". Because from his point of view, the one with the problem is probably you. You can not change the other person, you can say what is important for you and then, if they want, they can change. So then you state what you feel. As I usually say in my answers, don't ever use \"but\" or \"however\" after anything positive you said. For example if you just said you understand and respect him, if then you say \"but xxxx\" you are taking away from what you said first. So the next ideas shouldn't be a but, they should be \"this is how I feel\", he doesn't make you fee things, he does things and you have feelings over those things. This difference is rather important. I need you to take me seriously on this subject. In this two years we have been together, I don't feel you have. As I said, I understand we are different, so please understand me too. When you haven't brushed your teeth in two days, I don't feel like kissing you, I just can't, and It kills me because I really love you. When you don't shower after being out in the country all day, and you are covered in mud and you want to make love, I don't feel motivated, it makes me feel less attracted to you. I don't want to feel this way anymore. The idea here is to describe how what he does makes you feel, without blaming him. He does X you feel Y . What you feel is not his responsability. So you realized he does things that make you feel in ways you don't like. Therefore you communicate this to him and ask him to change otherwise you will have to leave. Then you ask him if he wants to change: I realize now that I will always feel this way, if you don't brush your teeth I won't feel inclined to kiss you and if you don't shower I won't feel as attracted to you. And I think if we continue this way we are going to be unhappy and maybe even get to hate each other. I don't want that. So, I ask you today, do you think you want to change those things? If you don't want to, if you feel you can't, or that doing that would be betraying yourself; please tell me. I am not asking you to change for me. I am asking you to change because you want. If you don't want it, that is alright, I understand it. I need an honest answer, don't feel obliged to say you want to change, because as I said I don't want to start hating each other, and I don't want to be crying anymore about this. You are my best friend and I want us to remain friends. So be honest with yourself and with me. Then you wait to see what he says. It is important that he doesn't do this for you . He has to do it because he wants , otherwise in the future he will say \"i did this for you\" and he may resent you. That is also why you don't tell him \"change or I will leave\". If he says he will change , that he wants to change because he loves you and wants yout o feel attracked to you. Then you tell him that you are glad and you are going to help him change if he wants . For example when he gets home you can start the shower, or whatever. But stop acting like his mom. You can get in the shower with him, the way you help him has to be playful, not like a job or duty. And it shouldn't be every time. If after a while he doesn't change, leave him, because he won't change and he probably lied so you wouldn't leave him. If he says he can't change , that he would like to change but he realizes he can't. Then you tell him that you understand and appreciate his honesty because is going to save you both a lot of hardship. You tell him you love him and leave . And since you had dinner ready already you won't feel so bad. Leave right away and tell him you will get in touch with him later to get your stuff. Don't get in touch right away, it is better if you let some time pass so when you talk to him again you won't feel inclined to say \"I am sorry lets get together again\". If he later contacts you or when he sees you, he says he is going to change . Well that is up to you to accept. If you accept do as I said above on the option \"if he says he will change\". Don't let keep going on forever . If he does change, take into account, that later on he may relapse . If he says he did this because you pushed him to do it, break up. You will have to monitor the relationship, so you don't get stuck forever if he really is not willing to change. I think, with some luck he will want to change because that kind of behavior is going to affect his life in general. If he doesn't change or want to change, it is not your fault . Don't see it as something wrong in you. That is on him. People don't change for other people, they change for themselves. Just be sure to get closure . Once you decide it is going to be the end, you can give him one retry, like I said above, but only if you really feel like it. Some people break a relationship, but don't give the other people closure. He could say something like \"now I can't change but maybe in the future\". That is a way to make you wait for him. Don't let that happen. Once is done, be done, close that door and don't expect him to come crawling . Otherwise you will be lovesick forever. I did this in my relatioship, but my boyfriend really didn't want to change . He told me so later on. I didn't notice that at the time, I realized later on, when it was too late and we had wasted time and the relationship had deteriorated so we couldn't even remain friends. That is why is important that he changes because he wants, not because you ask.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23562","post_title":"My boyfriend has issues with hygiene","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23562","timestamp":"2019-11-23T17:29:12","char_len":10982,"word_len":2201,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"You both have different expectations on hygiene Your question is \"how can I communicate this with him\", but you've already done so, and he already apologized and admitted that he'll try to change, so that part of the question has already been handled. The thing to remember here is that you are both on far ends of the hygiene spectrum, because you have high standards that few people will ever reach. I brush my teeth 3x a day, I shower at least 2-3 times a day because I work out I grew up with a father and a brother that are well kept and always smell like cologne. This is not a realistic standard to judge people by, most people will shower maybe every other day, 2-3 times a week. Brushing your teeth 3x a day is also not a normal level of hygiene, most online sources recommend 2 times. In addition, cologne isn't for everybody, just because you're used to men who wear cologne doesn't mean it's something \"everybody should do\". he would go 2 days without brushing his teeth. He has a job as a land surveyor so he\u2019s always outside going through trenches, mud etc., and he would come home put on his pajamas and not shower! Your boyfriend is on the other extreme end, he's vastly less concerned about personal hygiene than the average person. Most people wouldn't really skip a shower after going through a mud trench, but he seems perfectly fine with it. Neither of you is wrong , and it might be possible to meet somewhere in the middle, but you have to remember that your boyfriend seems perfectly okay living like a slob with having a pile of clothes laying on his bed, while you come across as a neat freak who puts an extreme importance on cleaning. You have drastically different expectations and you're most likely bothered about things your boyfriend doesn't even notice. Odds are your boyfriend does want to improve for you, but he simply doesn't know how because he doesn't see the problem as you see it. Communicate a medium that seems realistic to both of you, and then gently remind him of things that needs to happen. If you realize he smells, don't just hold your breath, ask him to take a shower. (Or offer to take a shower together.) If you remind him enough, he will eventually realize \"oh wait, Sarah Vee would like it if I do X\", even if it doesn't personally bother him.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"23562","post_title":"My boyfriend has issues with hygiene","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23562","timestamp":"2019-11-23T17:29:12","char_len":2326,"word_len":420,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"You've made it pretty clear that you want to avoid alienating your brother from telling you these things in the future. To do so, focus on delivering a clear and concise message by getting your point across in a few sentences. You do not want to prepare a speech, because repeating information your brother already knows is likely to make you sound like a pseudo-parent. You could casually mention some 'tips' for taking care of himself and gauging what he already knows by saying something like: Dude (however you address him), if you ever drink more than that, you want to make sure you drink water before you fall asleep or you'll feel like crap in the morning. or If you drink more than that, do you make sure to drink water before you go to bed so you don't feel like crap the next day? If you throw out casual tips, this earns his trust because you're sharing experienced advice with him ( even if you don't drink much\/often, it shows that you must still be knowledgeable enough to approach about it ). Best of all, it opens the door for him to come to you if he ever finds himself in need of advice or help. However, it's still probably important to tell him directly something along the lines of: Hey\/Also, now that I know you sometimes drink at parties, I just want to say that I'll always come get you if you need a ride. I'm never going to rat you out to Mom\/Dad, but I do want to make sure you get home safe if you ever drink more than just a of couple beers. I'm from the United States, but I've found that many of my friends parents who told them to \"just call\" regardless of if they felt they'd get in trouble, were much more likely to utilize them as a resource than those who didn't have that type of support.

{"comment_text":"I have a sister about three years younger than me, and from time to time over the past year we've had similar problems (albeit with less serious issues than drinking). There have been a couple of talks where I felt like she wasn't being as cautious as she should be, or where she'd fought with our parents and the argument hadn't reached a constructive conclusion. That said, there are a few things that have helped me in the past. 1. You're on his side. The first thing I'd make clear is that I'm on her side. I'm not just enforcing some arbitrary rule; I'm looking out for her safety. I know that parents say the same things sometimes, but it doesn't always carry the same weight. My sister's fought with my parents sometimes (as have I) because she couldn't understand that; in cases where I've said something, instead - well, it seems to get across better. We're alike enough, and we've been together since she was born, and that forms a bond. In plenty of cases, siblings don't like each other, and that can be a fact of life. But in others, there is a relationship that is different from a parent-child relationship. It might be easier than you think to make your brother think you're not talking down to him. 2. You're not enforcing rules for the sake of having rules. The second thing to get him to understand is that there's a point behind the rules. When we're little - and I mean grade school age - a lot of rules seem arbitrary because we don't understand them. It's kind of hard to shake the belief that some rules are there just for the sake of having rules. Maybe your brother just sees the benefits of drinking - he thinks it's fun, for instance - and doesn't see the downsides of having three beers. To be honest, you don't even have to explicitly acknowledge \"don't drink three beers irresponsibly\" like a rule - more of a really, really, really good suggestion that he should really really really follow. You don't have to quote statistics or tell him to watch anti-drinking videos; that's not going to get him to listen to you. But you could tell him, using common sense, why drinking that much unsupervised can be dangerous. Also, if you've had past experience with drinking - which I guess you haven't - you could also be in a position to say \"Hey, I know what not to do\". I like to say that the people that do best in interpersonal situations are the ones that have made mistakes in the past. 3. Address the future. You want to help him, right? You want him to stay safe; after all, that's the whole point of having the rule in the first place. So, talk to him about what can you do in the future to keep him safe, or mitigate the consequences if he does do something dangerous. Ask him to keep in touch with you (via phone), so you know he's okay. My sister's generally okay with this approach, but not everyone will be. Very few people want to be the uncool kid who has to keep checking in with his or her older sibling or parents, but he could do things discretely. If you know someone in the group, or someone who will be around them, ask if they can monitor him\/make sure he's okay. Make sure he has water or something similar on his person, which can dilute alcohol and hopefully help mitigate the effects. Know where he is planning to be, and maybe offer to pick him up. The worst thing that could happen is that he's both drunk and somewhere unknown.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"7661","post_title":"How can I express my concerns about my underage brother drinking alcoholic beverages to him without sounding like I&#39;m his mom?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/7661","timestamp":"2017-12-05T16:55:27","char_len":3411,"word_len":627,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"First off, you need to figure out what you are specifically concerned about. There are a few things you mention in the question: Legality Rules set by parents Safety issues There may be other things to consider: health, behavior (e.g. sex). Do you care about the law? You weren't subject to this law and I'm going to guess, having been a 16 year-old male, that he and his friends see this as a inherently unfair thing that has happened to their generation. In the US the drinking age is 21 and an overwhelming proportion of the population engages in underage drinking . Unfortunately, when the age limit on the drinking age is increased, the activity does not stop. Instead, it becomes more alluring as a badge of maturity and is driven underground such that there are no responsible adults around to manage and moderate the behavior of inexperienced drinkers. In other words, there's a distinct possibility that the drinking behavior of young in your country will become more irresponsible and dangerous than what you grew up with. Do you care about your parent's rules around this? He knows that's their rule so do you think reiterating it will make a difference? I would avoid this line of disucssion. It seems that your real concern is about safety. Giving him the privilege to have you pick him up any time is a great plan. I would even offer to get him some coffee and sober up if needed. I would also have a very frank talk about sex and drinking. This is something a big brother or big sister can do in a way that your parents never can. Talk protection (pregnancy and disease) as well as respecting women (assuming he is straight) and how to be a decent guy to them; especially when they are drunk. Make sure he understands your requirement of him that he survive this part of his life unscathed. Bad things can happen in these situations, as you know. This is where you should focus your efforts. The other issues are of little relative importance. It might be worth getting some details about someone who died or was maimed or ended up in serious legal trouble so he has a concept of what to avoid and how quickly things can spiral out of control. You won't be able to prevent him from drinking. All you can do is educate him.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"7661","post_title":"How can I express my concerns about my underage brother drinking alcoholic beverages to him without sounding like I&#39;m his mom?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/7661","timestamp":"2017-12-05T16:55:27","char_len":2275,"word_len":404,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"1. Ask yourself why you feel the need to do anything? You admit to drinking at the same age he is now, so why do you care that he does what you did? Did you have a bad experience? Do you think he's at risk of something awful? Personally, I'd simply let it slide. Loads of people in every country with a legal drinking age drink under age. For the majority there is no negative effect. 2. Talk to him about your own experiences But, if you still want to go ahead, talk to him about your own experiences. What have you done when you've been drunk that you regret? What did you see other people do? Tell him honestly about it. He is more likely to respect your experiences than you repeating information he already gets from authority figures.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"7661","post_title":"How can I express my concerns about my underage brother drinking alcoholic beverages to him without sounding like I&#39;m his mom?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/7661","timestamp":"2017-12-05T16:55:27","char_len":747,"word_len":140,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Let's get something out of the way before we get into what you should do: in some sense, you are trying to parent him. A parent's responsibility to their child is to prepare them to survive and to thrive. Parents do this primarily by a combination of imparting knowledge and training them by enforcing boundaries. This is a good thing, both individually for the child and for the people they will interact with over their lives. What you want to do is participate in this process with your brother. This is also a good thing; it stems from your desire to see your brother succeed. Where you draw the line is an appropriate place as well: even though you wish to help your brother, you do not have the authority of a parent to decide and enforce boundaries. So my first piece of advice is stop viewing \"sounding like his mom\" to your brother as a complete negative. In an ideal world, sounding like his mom just means you care about him and are trying to help him become the best person he can be. We'd all be better off if we could accept that from more people, especially those close to us. To actually approach this issue with him, start with the facts: Tell him how you feel. Be honest with him. Tell him that what he did makes you worry about his well being. Maybe it even scares you a little bit. You seem to have a good relationship with him, so being open about how this made you feel is both a good step in deepening that relationship and in starting the conversation about what happened. This also frames the discussion in \"I\" terms. You're not just commanding him to do something; you're explaining how it affected you personally. Find out what he thinks about the situation Once you've told him how you feel about it, find out his thoughts. Does he think he should have done anything differently? Does he wish he hadn't drunk anything? Does he wish he hadn't ridden home on his bike? Avoid opening with direct questions about specific things you think he should have done differently; doing so will sound like you're interrogating him. Listen very carefully to how he responds to your feelings first, and use those responses as a springboard for trying to understand what he thinks about it all. Talk about what he can do in the future Once you have some idea what he thinks about it, then you can start talking about what to do in future situations. You've already made it clear that you want him to be able to call you for a ride if he ever gets in this situation again; now is a good time to make that offer to him. Assuming he agrees that there was some part of it he should have done differently, you'll probably need to talk about what happened and why he ended up doing something he didn't intend to do. If he wishes he hadn't drunk anything, you can try to come up with some ideas of how to say no under social pressure. If he wishes he had drunk less or that he hadn't ridden home, you could talk to him about strategies for controlling how much alcohol he drinks in these situations. The bottom line here is that you are aiming to understand what happened and help him come up with ideas about how it can be handled differently in the future. If the conversation leads to it, talk about the dangers. This is probably the point where it's easiest to fall into a \"sermon\" sort of approach. So my advice is don't plan to go there specifically. If a specific question comes up or it seems like there's something he doesn't understand, answer it or discuss that particular issue. Don't go into dangers that don't arise naturally from the conversation. If you feel the need to mention something he already knows or he seems to know something based on his responses, don't belabor the point. Just mention it and move on. Don't dwell too long on anything that comes up in this vein. Don't mention telling your parents at all There are two reasons you shouldn't mention this: If you steer the conversation as described above, I don't think you'll even give the impression that you might tell them. So there's really no need to even mention it; that would just make him consider the possibility of it happening. Presumably, there's some point of extremity at which you would tell them because they need to know and you all need to figure something out for his own benefit. You don't want to box yourself into a corner where now you have to decide between breaking a promise not to and doing something to help him. Decide ahead of time what you're going to do if he doesn't want to talk about it Before you even start this conversation, you need to decide what you're going to do if he doesn't want to have it. At any point of resistance, your options are: Walk away without continuing the conversation. Divert to a different point that he's more comfortable with Press a little harder. Decide now what line you won't cross if he resists talking about it. Will you before you tell him how you feel? Will you insist on telling him how you feel, but stop at trying to get what he thinks out of him? Decide what you'll whether you'll press the conversation or not at each point, and be prepared for that. Remind him you love him Give him a hug, or whatever you normally do with your family to express affection.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"7661","post_title":"How can I express my concerns about my underage brother drinking alcoholic beverages to him without sounding like I&#39;m his mom?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/7661","timestamp":"2017-12-05T16:55:27","char_len":5278,"word_len":959,"lang":"en"}

See how disheveled and disgusting the bathroom has become? See someone just having trouble walking or just generally out of control? Point all that out. Still at the same time keep it fun and not lecture like, you'll be at a fun place after all.

Its easy too man, you really gotta be careful with this stuff. For me this provided basically a mini scared straight moment.

This is strictly between you and him, no need to inform the parents. It's a little bonus to compensate for the \"fun\" he missed by not being drunk. You can also make a deal: you'd cover for him occasionally if he really needs it, but only if he's reasonable enough. You could inquire why he drank alcohol. Was it because everyone else did? Encourage him to observe the effect on others, that can be quite spectacular... Was it for the fun? While drinking a little bit can increase the fun, too much will spoil the evening (and the next day). If he never got drunk and learned the feeling of a massive hangover, maybe he doesn't know that!

Also insurance will most likely not pay if there is an accident etc. I personally think having a few beers at a party with 16 is not a big problem. On the other hand it is totaly not okay to endanger others while driving drunk. You should make this totally clear. Tell him he should have walked home or if it is too far for him - he should have stayed sober.

{"comment_text":"Yesterday, he confessed to me he had 3 beers at the party, and he wasn't sleepy but halfway drunk. I didn't push him for that information, he told me out of the blue From this I can tell your brother wanted some kind of feedback from you. Maybe it was his first time drinking beer without parental consent. Maybe he felt guilty or maybe he was seeking approval. Or perhaps it was something he was that proud of that he felt he needed to say. Note however that if he was halfway drunk he might have drank more than 3 beers. How can I express my concerns about my underage brother drinking alcoholic beverages to him without sounding like I'm his mom? Is your goal to express your concerns, or is your goal to safeguard your brother from drinking too much and falling into the canal? They are different goals, and you can change behaviors of others without verbally expressing your concerns.(Sometimes expressing your concern to someone, like you're their mom, can have the opposite effect when they feel their freedom is threatened. This phenomenon is also known as \"reactance\".) Two concepts that are important: Attitude: If your brother has a positive attitude towards alcohol he is more likely to binge drink. Positive attitudes come from positive feelings and thoughts. If your brother associates alcohol consumption with being cool or being an adult or belonging to his peers, then he is more likely to drink. If his peers drink a lot he is more likely to do so. When his parents allowed him to drink at a young age, he is more likely to drink, because of the perceived harm reduction. To change his attitude you should make him aware that it is not cool to drink. You could for example quit drinking yourself which sends a strong message that drinking is not something which makes you a better person. You can verbally express that drinking is not something that makes you a grown-up. You do not have to address your brother directly. Ability: Besides inducing opposing attitudes, your brother should have the ability to change his behavior. If all of his friends drink a beer each hour, he's likely to succumb. You could give your brother hints to drink a soda first before starting to drink beer. This will sent a message to his friends that he chooses to drink what he likes, and they can choose whatever they want to drink themselves. The feeling of empowerment will make him more in control and a create a positive attitude towards controlling his drinking behavior. You can show this behavior yourself to him whenever you go to a terrace or bar. Or tell him directly when you were with your friends that you told them \"I'm not drinking tonight.\" Then your friends started nagging \"Why are you not drinking?\" you stood tall and said \"I don't feel like it\" and just switched the topic. This way you can communicate to your brother skills of how to be in control of his own behavior without directing your brother's behavior directly. Tying positive consequences to performing the behavioral skills increases the motivation and likelihood of performing the skills thereby strengthening them. Also, you should know that this problem might solve itself over time. At age 16 people want to experience stuff. They may have difficulty to control their behavior, and may have difficulty to say no. You can support him by giving him to tools to perform more mature behavior, and expressing the values you hold which your brother of course is allowed to disagree with.

{"comment_text":"I did not have this problem often, but experience taught me that the best solution is to just let them be. Of course it is feels deeply uncomfortable to allow them to remain with their wrong \"knowledge\", but your well-intended efforts will germinate as well as some seeds spread in some hot desert. So shortly, I do something like this: Get into the discussion somehow. Try to explain the correct version of the \"story\". If the other person is receptive, continue the discussion. If the other person already \"knows\" that I am from another planet, I just mumble loudly-enough a \"Maybe you are right and I am wrong, we will see...\" and let the discussion die. In your case (as well as as in my case too, in the past) the conflict is not really a conflict of information, but a conflict of two people needing to prove that they are right. It is less important that you are right (hopefully) and they are wrong. You both try to prove that you are right at the expense of the other one - and that will not end well unless one gives up. Usually, the wiser gives up first.

{"comment_text":"Is politeness your primary goal? Or is the primary goal not to let someone talk nonsense that others might believe, mixed with you not liking to be told that you don't know anything about your job? Let's say you are an excellent car mechanic. I tell people that in order to solve engine problem X they should do Y. You know this will damage the engine. Then you can say \"do that, and you'll have to pay for a new engine\". Get the tone right. What you say should not sound like bragging, or starting an argument, but like a plain statement of fact, that cannot be changed by any discussion. If you get it right, I will know the outcome of doing Y will be having to pay for a new engine, and contradicting you will result in me looking like a fool. But what you say should also sound just like stating true facts, not like accusing me of being stupid. And of course you better be right with what you state. Another approach is asking \"explain that to me\". If you are told \"but everyone knows that\", you can say \"I don't know that, so could you explain this\". That's more polite, and probably no explanation will be forthcoming.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28890","post_title":"How to politely tell someone that I&#39;m more knowledgeable than them in a particular area?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28890","timestamp":"2024-11-10T17:49:57","char_len":1129,"word_len":212,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"You're right and you're wrong about your assumptions. You certainly cannot force him to not text and drive, as he is an adult. However, he is endangering your safety and if that bothers you then you should speak up . Your other friends seem okay with that. And that's fine for them, but don't count on their support. In fact, when you speak to your texting friend, make sure your friends aren't there to back him up. First and foremost: 1. Refuse to be in a car with him unless he doesn't text and drive We all have our risk tolerances, but we must respect our differences in that regard. Your friend has no right to make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Be firm, but not rude. This is all you have to say: Either I drive, or you stay off your phone while driving, or I don't wish to come with you guys. Sorry. If your friend chooses his phone over your friendship, that's quite a problem. Your safety is more important than any interpersonal skills. Note: If this issue is a little less serious, and you don't mind dragging it out longer to possibly reach a more amicable solution, you can try to convince your friend to stop his habit, at least around you, which leads me to... 2. Talk to your friend, privately You've already tried saying something while he does it. He knows you don't like it and he's made his decision. Your only choice to convince him is a private conversation. This conversation is going to be highly contextual, so I cannot give you many things to say. However, you must make it about your safety\/comfort, not about his ability . He may be the best driver in the world, perhaps with an incredible multi-tasking ability. Perhaps he has 2 brains and 4 working arms. Well, chances are he's like the rest of us, and is statistically unable to text and drive without risking at least a moderate amount of safety. Regardless, you need to make him understand that the consequence of his action is that your experience is damaged. And you need him to tell you whether or not he cares about that. If he doesn't... see option 1. PS: Leave out any details about his phone usage outside of driving. That issue is a separate (but probably related) issue. However, you need to tackle one at a time. Trying to mix the details will weaken your position and point, and decrease your chances of solving either conflict.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"18622","post_title":"Cellphone-obsessed friend (and driver)","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/18622","timestamp":"2018-09-20T15:43:35","char_len":2377,"word_len":424,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"First up: Hats off for being so self-reflected and taking responsibility. I've been in a relationship with a borderliner and it didn't survive (the relationship). Because you are absolutely right, BPD is hell for those around you (and probably for you as well). That said, forget about people not taking things personal. When you lash out at someone, that absolutely is personal. What else could it be? What can smooth things over is to take responsibility and make amends - the same thing anyone should do when they've messed up. Something as simple as \"So sorry for that earlier. Let me pay for the drinks, ok?\" can already work. The key component is to understand and admit that you've caused some damage, and then undoing that damage as good as possible. Also understand that the things you mention are highly unusual and that's why your friends refuse. For example, you try to isolate yourself, but what friends do to each other is to be there in bad times, and even more so if the person suffering says stuff like \"I don't want to be a burden\". By social convention, they will tell you that you're not a burden and understand it as \"I really, really need someone right now\". Honestly, from what you write, it seems to me that you are doing a lot of the right things and it's just in the nature of BPD that it doesn't work as easily and completely as you want. Reiterating some points to your friends, especially the point that if it gets too much they can totally disappear for a few days and you won't hold it against them, is key. Such unconventional messages won't be believed until you've repeated them several times.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28778","post_title":"How to make friendships work with borderline personality disorder","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28778","timestamp":"2024-07-16T18:07:57","char_len":1639,"word_len":291,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"It is awesomely courageous of you, to reach out to your friends and be open about your condition\/illness. This is the right way, I would say. Problem is, even if it is more than evident to you, that you have told them everything and all their options and maybe you feel relieved about it - they are prone to forget everything during the times where everything is running smoothly and then cannot remember a word you explained them when something bad happens between you. So, from what you told, I would say, you cannot do much more. Except being prepared and willing to repeatedly explain those things in the right moments. Be genuine about your feelings about what happened, if something happened. I think you are already, that is an invaluable feat! Also prepare them maybe that you can only apologize after the fact and this might not be a guarantee that it will never happen again. But keep in mind: After all, it is a mental illness . If someone is suffering under a certain condition, this is not done voluntarily. You are in a way innocent , but (severely) handicapped. Someone else might break a leg and everybody around is in shock. He can apologize for being the \"cause of trouble\" later. But this also would not be a guarantee for it not happen again (could also happen to somebody else in the same group). It was a special situation, an accident . Nobody would demand to always wear protective gear afterwards to avoid having this happen ever again. You are not numb to the feelings of others. On the contrary, you try to (overly) protect them from \"you being a burden\". But this is your subjective view on yourself. You have to allow the others to take responsibility for their feelings towards you in the way they think it is best for them. You do not need to find a way of behaving in a way that is best for them (this is like forcing yourself wearing protective gear or worse keeping a distance in the hopes that this will not happen again - this is like imposing a punishment on yourself just because you are you... that does not help anyone!). You need to find a way that is best for you . Rely on the fact that they will do the same for themselves. Meaning, given some lashing out happened: The situation somehow dissolves, like both of you going home in distress. A day later you realize what happened and want to mend things and reach out to the other person (which alone deserves deepest respect for doing the first step!). If the other is not ready yet, then you have to give more time. Respect the behavior of the others as you want your behavior be respected by them. If they agree on sorting things out, great, be there for them - if you also want\/be able to! If they at some point decide, they can no longer stand the friendship to you, and you cannot do something against it (which also needs to be okay for you!), then ultimately you have to let them go their way. Even if you will be devastated and sad and never want this to happen to you, that would be something you cannot prevent solely on your own. There need to be two willing to uphold the friendship. Sounds hard to realize and it is. So just try to embrace the thought step by step. In the end I think it makes things easier for you and your friends. Even if it means you lose some of them, others will stay at your side and ever so strongly. To the point of bad remarks on BPD: You can see this as a kind of accolade towards you (although with a bad taste of course). They are not seeing you as being of the same group as they make the remarks on. You can see it as them being ignorant towards you and also mean towards the others (which is valid!), which of course, increases your resentment against your friends and the wish to support the other BPD people - also in order to not have the feeling of denying yourself. I would give the advise (if the situation permits, which I imagine to happen at some distance, not a physical engagement), observe your feelings in that moment, but try to keep yourself away of being the \"justice police\" in that situation. You do not need to scold them on the spot (except of course it takes on insulting dimensions). You can of course also make a remark about the behavior of your friends in that situation (idk, like \"shut up\" or \"don't be mean\" - should be in the same range of intensity as they used). Rather, because I think you are a reflective person, give yourself the time to think things over and then seek a more quiet situation where you can talk about your feelings you observed in you, with your friends, or even in solo instead of the whole group. You do not have to deny anything and you are allowed to confront your friends with your feelings. But you should also chose the right moment and also be prepared to face their reactions. I wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart!","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28778","post_title":"How to make friendships work with borderline personality disorder","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28778","timestamp":"2024-07-16T18:07:57","char_len":4869,"word_len":902,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I had a similar problem a few years ago. A particular commuter (who I knew from a previous employment) would spot me on the platform and insist on coming up and talking to me. Because we have friends and colleagues in common and because there was a strong possibility I'd end up working with them in future, I was extremely keen not to offend them by pretending to be on a call or by listening to loud music. In the end I found the ideal solution; I simply avoided them. I found a spot where I could stand some distance away from the platform and observe the track. I'd walk onto the platform just as the train was arriving, spot which car this person was alighting, then pick a different one. You usually get a few minutes to get on board and it's an easy matter to just not be in the same place as them. Actions you may wish to take: You absolutely need to complain to the station staff (by phone and or letter) each and every time you're harassed. His behaviour is not acceptable and they need to provide personnel to supervise both the platform and the train. If they fail to cooperate, start to make formal complaints about them as well as threatening to contact your Senator and Representative. Start keeping a log of his activities and make sure the staff get copies. Speak to other female commuters. If he's harassing them as well, they may have developed strategies to prevent contact that you can use. Perhaps buttonhole them as they walk away from the station or hand them a card with your email address on. In the UK there's a group called \"Passenger Focus\" that campaigns for the rights of rail passengers. There may be a similar group in the Netherlands. Reaching out to them may be useful. Speak to the police. On several occasions you said that he's been aggressive or violent. This is not an acceptable set of circumstances, even if he's developmentally disabled. They may offer some assistance by speaking to his parents, speaking to him directly or providing staff for the platform. They may also contact the train company to ask them what actions they're taking for your protection. Again, make this their problem and not just your problem. Speak to a solicitor . I gather there's something called a contactverbod that acts as a temporary restraining order.

{"comment_text":"I agree with the suggested actions in this answer by Valorum -- report it to the train station every time it happens, keep a log, and confer with the other affected women. But I noticed something additional in your question that hasn't been addressed: A developmentally disabled person has to take the same train to get to this special workplace for developmentally disabled people . So you have somebody who's dangerously aggressive and invasive, who according to the police can't be held responsible for his actions, but he's in some sort of special program . My next step in your situation would be to contact the people in charge of that special workplace. If they are responsible for training him in life skills, they need to know about this profound failure so they can address it. If they are not responsible for that -- if they're just a workplace that has agreed to employ developmentally-disabled people -- then they, in turn, must be working with somebody else who's making the connections -- a government agency, a clinic or hospital, an advocacy group, or something similar, and they ought to be able to help you escalate your complaint. (I haven't been in your situation; my threatening encounters with mentally-unstable individuals have been one-time encounters, not every day, and the methods of dealing with them are different. I'm drawing this answer from experience escalating complaints within the workplace and other organizations; those situations weren't threatening in the way that yours is, but \"involve the person who is somehow superior to the problem person\" is the approach that has worked for me.) In a later comment you added: I have just started trying some of the approaches here this week. So far, trying to steer the conversation away to other smalltalk (as suggested by Yosef Baskin) has failed. Apparently his obsession (see the comment on that answer) is getting to know as much personal details from a female as possible (where do you live? is his favourite question). I made sure to tell the male commuter I know from church what I was going to try, and he has 'rescued' me twice this week. I'll try it for the rest of this week, if nothing changes I will ask the other females to take some organized action. You are describing warning signs of stalking, particularly the attempts to get personal information about you. The common advice when dealing with repeated harassment of the creepy variety (examples: 1 2 3 4 ) is: don't engage, do seek help . You've already tried telling him to leave you alone; it didn't work. Under no conditions should you give him any information that he could use to cause even more trouble for you. Ignoring him isn't working for you either, and is unlikely to. Report this to the train station and his workplace, as already mentioned. Further, you and the other women should strongly consider contacting the police. Even if they say they can't do anything, having the reports on file -- starting to build a paper trail -- could help later. Who knows; they might have said \"we can't do anything\" when they thought it was one harmless pest bothering one person, but if they see that it's multi-target, sustained harassment, perhaps they'll try harder to help you.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"775","post_title":"How to deal with a dangerous, developmentally disabled person I can not avoid?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/775","timestamp":"2017-07-23T09:18:34","char_len":3289,"word_len":553,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"OP here, with an update: Almost six weeks have passed now. The problem is going to resolve itself for me, but not in a very satisfying way. I am switching customers while continuing work for the same company, and I will soon be taking a different\/no train each day. There were some suggestions of trying to make other small talk. I notified the male from church, and tried this for about a week. That week was no fun at all! So in this case, that definitely did not work. But I really liked the idea, and I afterwards was very glad I tried it first. So I kicked aside all my nerves, and asked three complete strangers if they were just as bothered by this as me. I bonded together with three other females, we exchanged phone numbers and devised a plan of attack. We made some video of the bad behaviour, and started reporting every incident via twitter (private messages) to the train's customer service. We went again to his parents, and showed them the video. They were quite shocked. We left some video material with them, and they promised to confront their son about it and get more help for him. I felt bad about this the whole time, but am glad afterwards glad I started doing something. We are completely ignoring him if he is talking in the silence carriage, and one of us leaves to get train personnel, explains the situation on the way and we always succeeded in having him removed. Ignoring him seems to be helping more than telling him to shut up, sometimes he now even leaves when we threaten to stand up. (He still curses and makes empty threats all the way while leaving though). He is also still not able to just leave us alone, or to start a conversation in a normal way\/about a normal topic. We have agreed to stand together, greet when he greets, but not react any further if he behaves inappropriately. We have not involved the police as yet, since his parents promised to get him more help. In six weeks, we have seen very minor improvements. His aggressive behaviour seems a little bit less aggressive. I agreed with my new three friends to go have drinks some where a few weeks after my new job starts, so we can discuss if it is needed to go the police.

{"comment_text":"I had a very similar issue with a man who suffered from a traumatic brain injury while I was volunteering at a local food bank. It started much as you describe. He was just a little too aggressive with the women, not necessarily dangerous, but he had a habit of being a little too familiar and often times saying very inappropriate things. Unfortunately, I was usually the male figure who had to step in and tell him to settle down. This seemed to work at first, and while supervised he was mostly harmless. Things came to a head one evening when I wasn't there and he approached an underage girl. He said the sort of things that he usually said to women and things got out of hand quickly... Not only was the girl endangered, but the disabled man was as well when the girl's parents were told what had happened. I bring this up, because it's a fairly likely scenario that comes up with situations like this. The man's caretakers were well aware that he had these issues. They weren't providing adequate supervision to someone that they knew posed a risk to himself and others. That turns out to be a key phrase in situations like this. \"A risk to himself and others\" The laws may be different where you live, but generally speaking that's the acid test. Once someone presents a risk to themselves or others, they should be getting more care and supervision. If the man's caretakers are aware of the issue and they aren't taking steps to provide that care and supervision, they're inadvertently neglecting their responsibilities. We ended up handling the situation by contacting the man's caretakers directly. We informed them of what had happened and told them that he was no longer welcome on the property unless accompanied by a guardian. We went on to explain that failing to provide supervision may leave them responsible for the man's actions if anything happened in the future. I would strongly advise you to call the police each time this problem occurs, and encourage them to contact the man's caretakers. Make it clear that this person's actions feel sexually aggressive in nature, and that by ignoring the problem they're putting the disabled man and the general public in danger. It's not uncommon for people to minimize these problems until something really bad happens.

Get them to sign a letter or petition corroborating your findings. If talking to train authorities doesn't do the job, go to the police. If the above doesn't work, see a lawyer, and maybe have him\/her contact a legislator. I don't know how it works in the Netherlands, but in America, people sometimes volunteer to work in a legislator's office for the right ot speak to them.

This idea, though, has to do with results, not justice. Shifting the dialogue to my liking by taking charge of the conversation succeeded in the past: When I realized an aged neighbor was picking fights simply to force me into conversation, I instead initiated my own normal small talk with her. Problem solved. Again, HE hasn't earned this, but if it works, why not? This would mean shifting the vile conversation to \"How are you today? I've seen you around. You have family here?

{"comment_text":"I am sorry you have to go through this daily ordeal. The last sentence of your post says: I have tried several ways of dealing with this person, but they either have no effect, or they leave me feeling bad about myself \/ being scared because of his reaction. How can I deal with him better. First, please stop feeling bad about yourself -- that you are \"the bad girl.\" You are not. He is harassing you; you are minding your own business. Yes, it is unfortunate that he has mental problems, but this is not your fault, you cannot solve his problems, life is unfair. Second, analyze why you are scared. It is not clear from your post whether he is physically dangerous or just a (horrible) nuisance. Has he ever touched a woman? If yes, the situation is acutely dangerous; in the US the police would take it seriously. If no, that doesn't mean he never will, but the danger is on a lower level. I understand that you just want to go to and from work in peace, but you and the other women may have to get together and work as a group, as @Tom Au suggested. Options for consideration: work out schedules so none of you is ever by yourself in his vicinity hire a lawyer (you can tell I am from the US!) to ask about legal options (restraining order?), and what you can legally do to defend yourself in what specific circumstances. arrange a self-defense class get advice from a feminist group I strongly support the advice of other posters that you and the other women report every incident of harassment to the police. And, I repeat: none of this is your fault. A quick search on Google brought up this article from DutchNews.nl, Labour seeks to make sexual harassment on the streets a crime . I don't know what the status of this legislation is, but this and other articles I found on the Web indicates that the harrassment of women is too common in the Netherlands.

If of course the former is true, all suggestions so far are helpful.

If he is only talking loudly and so on, maybe you know... some small talk, some simple conversation will relax him and maybe make him a bit of a better person too?

{"comment_text":"While I agree with the comments saying that in the example you give, Bartok sounds quite reasonable and makes efforts to be non-confrontational, I also think there are things you can try to show you're invested in the idea. The thing about the example conversation, is that depending on how you read (tone, facial expressions, etc...), it can be seen as both side : Bartok trying to understand, or Bartok trying to poke holes. Bartok can show he's more invested, by showing genuine interest. Instead of asking a general question (such as \"Can you explain the logic ?\"), which put the burden of explaining on the other person, Bartok could instead show his own reasoning. For example : Arthika: Right, so then we should put the foo in the bar? Bart\u00f3k: I'm not following the logic. As far as I remember, all quxes happened because foo was wrongly linked to the baz. But the foo doesn't appear in bar, so I don't think it would help, right ? Arthika: No, but in bar [...] I've had multiple similar conversations with coworkers about technical topics, on both sides (being the one not understanding and being the one trying to explain a new idea), and pro-actively trying to explain why you think this idea is not working always led the conversation to a constructive place, as opposed to just saying \"I don't get it\". The thing is, when I try to explain a new idea and the other person just say \"I don't get it\", I have no \"entry point\" for a constructive conversation. I can simply answer \"what is the part you don't understand\", which isn't helpful. But if the other person highlights his understanding of the problem, I can either spot the misunderstanding and correct them, or dive into more details about the thing we are talking about. It's a way to align together on the subject, to ensure we have the same understanding, when usually one person has more domain knowledge than the other. Similarly, when someone exposes his idea and I don't follow the logic, by exposing my own logic, I prompt the other person to go into finer details, which usually develops into a constructive conversation (i.e. one of us was misunderstanding a piece of the code and the conversation clarifies this misunderstanding)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28864","post_title":"How to ask for clarification multiple times without appearing to challenge?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28864","timestamp":"2024-10-04T00:54:08","char_len":2232,"word_len":386,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Cliques are inherently closed off. People who participate in cliques generally enjoy the exclusiveness, strengthened friendships, and sense of security that comes with them. Of course, there's nothing wrong with this, since perhaps the people involved may have known each other for several\/many years, share some fairly unique feature\/interest (e.g., having the same alma mater), or, a combination of both. Because of this, those who are already involved in a clique are sometimes somewhat reluctant to inviting new members, and especially \"for no reason\". That being said.. Give it time. Even though your son is just a transfer from a different floor, he's still probably considered by most as \"the new guy\", or, \"that other guy\". I would suggest that your son [calmly] keep this in mind, as well as the fact that he'll be working with these people for the next while, so there should be no rush. It may be difficult to do, but I believe your son's best course of action is to simply play it cool [for now] and let time do its thing , and hopefully things will develop organically. Coming off as overly eager is a big turn off for a clique, and will only increase the distance that's between your son and his coworkers. So, what can be done for now? I think it would be a good idea, if your son hasn't already, to explicitly acknowledge that the people in the clique seem to be good friends , making sure to do so with a positive tone of voice (as if he is genuinely happy for them, with good friends being a rarity these days). This could be as simple as casually mentioning it to just one person in the clique, and then starting a conversation as to how they all know each other, who's been here the longest, etc.. When talking about this, your son should make sure to not offer information about himself, unless he is directly asked. Instead, the focus of the conversation should be on his coworkers, and how things operate from a social perspective, on his new floor. Also, your son should not talk about his old floor, unless directly asked . By your son engaging in this kind of conversation, he demonstrates that he is interested in learning how this floor operates, that he's able to carry on a conversation, and that he's at least curious as to what the social dynamics of the floor are. This is the most passive, nonaggressive your son can be when attempting to communicate that he wants to be considered socially, while at the same time not coming off as pushy. But the biggest thing is to be genuine, don't be overly eager, and to demonstrate that [your son] is capable of being social, just like everyone else.

{"comment_text":"There is one thing you didn't mention in your question. Whether your son likes this group of people. It's easier to join a coterie if you admire and genuinely like its members. If his main reason for wanting to be included in the \"clique\" or \"gang\" is loneliness, he risks appearing desperate and, even worse, sycophantic. Any attempt to break the barrier will be thwarted. On the other hand, if his main concern is to be part of an efficient and productive team, then it is fundamental he finds out who the leader is. In any typical group, there is always a leader, it's usually the person who has been there the longest and has earned their peers' respect. Once your son has identified who that \"leader\" is, he can approach this person and ask them for advice. Not advice on how to be accepted, but advice about work, patients, doctors, etc. that sort of thing. Even if your son already knows his job, and exactly how to perform it, he still needs to show respect (and some deference) to his colleagues. There is always something new to learn. See also @Charlie's very valid piece of advice Instead, the focus of the conversation should be on his coworkers, and how things operate from a social perspective, on his new floor . With luck, the \"leader\" should be able to impart invaluable tips and advice about the floor which your son can put into immediate practice. It takes time before a group accepts a stranger in its midsts but if he is humble, kind and willing to put in the extra hours at work (for a reasonably limited amount of time) it will get easier. Tip 1 To help oil the wheels of bonding, he ought to invite colleagues for an evening drink, an aperitif or arrange to meet at the local coffee shop. The first time he should offer to pay, he's the \"new guy\", and he did the inviting. These small social gatherings help people to get to know each other better as they tend to be friendlier when they are relaxed and outside work. Tip 2 Asking if colleagues have spouses and children is always a good conversation opener, and from there you can ask about their kids' ages and if they have any photos of them they would like to share. Tip 3 Next time, he should head confidently to the table in the cafeteria where everyone is sitting and ask: Would you mind if I join you? It's just for five minutes, I have this niggling problem with blah, blah, blah. (make it work oriented) Who will be so anti-social as to reject a polite request? By stating it will only be five minutes, he is acknowledging that they may have better use of their free time than to discuss his problem, it is their break too, but he is also saying it will not take up all their break time. Tip 4 Show his co-workers that he works hard and does everything he is expected to, and more. Never be late for work, and forget about asking favours, e.g. \u201cCan you stand in for me next Monday morning? I need to pick up mom at the airport\u201d However, he must show a willingness to do favors and go that extra mile. If he does the above and displays common courtesies he will eventually earn their trust and respect .","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"3680","post_title":"How to break into a clique?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/3680","timestamp":"2017-09-11T04:30:56","char_len":3141,"word_len":574,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Don't overthink it . What may come easy to you, and may not appear \"smart\" to you, may be to others. If someone pays you a compliment, feel good about your self , and acknowledge it. If you think there is nothing to feel good because \"it is not true as it isn't very impressive\", realise you are being too literal - you should feel good about helping someone with your skills, or teaching someone something they didn't know about, and telling you \" You are smart \" is their way of appreciating it and thanking you for your help . Compliments are all about appreciating one another, and it\u2019s just as important to learn how to graciously accept a compliment, as learning how to give a good one. When you deny a compliment, you may be giving the impression that someone else\u2019s perspective is wrong, and you may make them feel bad for trying to say something nice to you. (Ref. 1) I. In a formal setting (school, work, strangers etc.) acknowledge the compliment by saying: Thank you, it is very kind of you to say that. (or) I appreciate you saying so. II. In an informal setting (friends or family) , you could: Joke about it : \"Finally, you acknowledge it!\" \"Yeah, I am a genius!\" \"Are you saying I am smarter than you too?\" etc. ... and then acknowledge it formally (see I). Note that whether others find the joke humourous depends a lot on how you deliver it. It helps to remember that the success of the joke depends on the non-verbal cues too - your body language, your facial expression, your tone etc. - when you say it. And it also depends on how well you know the other person and understand what kind of sense of humour they have and what makes them laugh. If somebody doesn't get the joke, it is ok - just say, \"I was joking. Thank you very much for your compliment. It felt nice to hear it.\" Acknowledge it formally (see I) and add a clarification (if you want to). [Thanks ..] The truth is, I am good at it because I spent a lot of time practicing \/ learning it. Acknowledge it formally (see I) and offer to help ... and since you are my dear \/ good friend or such a nice \/ kind\/ person, let me know anytime when you want my help on this. (Or use a combination of 1, 2 or 3). Offering compliments are sometimes also an attempt to convey to you that the other person likes you and would like to get to know you better.

{"comment_text":"My sympathies to you both. This happened to married friends of mine about a decade ago (still married!). He was an active athlete, and from a sudden accident, became a paraplegic paralyzed from the upper chest down. Thus, I gained a tiny bit of insight into what's involved. I think this situation is too serious to handle via an internet QA site. Not that there is anything wrong with asking here. All opinions can be helpful (as long as one remembers that, when you get down to it, this is just a place where \"internet randos\" voice their answers to questions, and other \"internet randos\" vote on those answers). I'm interested to read what my fellow \"randos\" write. But, like community member rhoona, I think seeking assistance from a professional therapist (or better yet, psychologist) is your best choice because you love your girlfriend and hopefully love yourself. Something to discuss with a professional therapist (in a space of honesty and non-judgement, and certainly no judgement from me): Who will her caregiver be, if not you? That's not to say her caregiver can only be you. But just that she likely will need help and that you love her. Separately, kindly note that caregiving is an art and a science, and you are understandably new to it, which explains many of your experiences. Learning about caregiving, at any level, is always requisite to being successful at it. Also, you seem very concerned about the financial side. Don't be. First, of all, trust me, money does not bring happiness. That's one of the biggest fallacies in many places on the little planet we share. I've been around people of all walks of life, and the only certain correlation I've witnesses between money and happiness is that most wealthy people are miserable and empty inside. As the wise saying goes: Mo' money, mo' problems. On the topic of money, even if the two of you eventually do get married, her injury took place before your marriage. Thus, a qualified financial advisor will likely be able to prevent her medical expenses from impacting you much, if at all. SCI (Spinal Cord Injury) support groups can be a great resource to learn about these topics too.

{"comment_text":"Maybe not an exact answer to your question, but one I wanted to give anyway: I love being alone. I still do, after living together many years. I love being alone for longer periods too. I've concluded that, weighting the pro's and cons, I like being alone but I like the other benefits more. A helping hand etc., someone to discuss big issues with, someone who tells me I'm wrong or simply someone who listens. My wife and I had a conversation that I require alone time. And I don't just mean an hour once in a while, but something more significant. What works for us is: She sometimes initiates a weekend away with friend, go on a small trip or something, leaving the house to me. She likes doing things like that and I get the house to myself. She goes to a friend for some social time and when she comes home late in the evening, I get a \"good night\" and a kiss (maybe a very small convo) and then she goes to bed. She goes to bed to read, I have the last hour of the day solo. She likes to read, I like alone, win-win She took an evening shift. At first she didnt because she thought I would mind, but knowing I like the solo time, so took the shift. That benefitted her too. This was the result of multiple conversation accross a few years, you need to find a status quo which works for both. It felt a bit odd in the beginning, as your \"supposed to\" love eachother fulltime. I do, but I also like the precense of no-one. I've explained this as best I could to her, that this has nothing to do with here. I enjoy her presence and I also enjoy being alone. It gives me time to do exactly what I want, when I want to. That gives me an inner rest hard to get in another way. Part of this arrangement is that we put a little more focus on being together somewhere else. We eat dinner together, or shower together, or plan an activity for the weekend to do together. You could say to keep the average at a healthy level. I recommend you self reflect what you liked about being alone. Find what you like and how you can implement parts of that in your current setting. And this can be a work in process and evolve. And then have the conversation with your partner. Place a little emphasis that its not about her , as people feel that it is easily. Then: I think that trying to un-move her might turn into a relation-ender. Many people don't want to live solo and for most people moving out feels like a step back.

{"comment_text":"What you describe has nothing related to IPS per se , but to psychology, and is more of a mild form of resilience and \" level 1 unconscious gaslighting \" with a little bit of coercion and a little bit of scapegoating: Resilience is the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands . You wonder 1. what you did in order for you to face this kind of behaviour (repeatedly asking), and 2. why people do what they do and ask again. Answers are pretty small and straightforward: Nothing special. Has the situation evolved? Now, if you analyse the 2 situations, you'll see a common pattern. People want to know if you changed your mind. As for the employer, it's a pretty standard behaviour: they keep in touch and want you to know that they're still available, letting you know that, if you changed your mind, the position is there for you to negociate. They expect an answer only if you're interested. Don't try and negociate or make your point(s) or convince them, it's a plain and simple YES\/NO. As for your family, it's the same thing: did time make its office and make you change your mind? By asking again, people (consciously or not), want to sow the seeds of doubt in your mind. Maybe you have changed your mind (or will), maybe you'll feel guilty after refusing once again, maybe you won't have enough strength to say no once more... You can identify this behaviour as early as kindergarden-time, when toddlers repeatedly say the same thing, thinking you'll change your mind just because they say it, and say it, and say it again. People behave like this because \" no \" doesn't seem to be an answer. They keep pushing with the hope that you'll change your mind. You did nothing wrong, it's human nature to behave like they do. Now, as the IPS answer to that, experience taught me that the only two ways to deal with it are: 1. quietly and firmly stand your ground 2. ignore them or their request, depending on the situation (if personal or professional) and the relationship. In your case #1, as it's a professional, not big deal not to answer. Keep in touch only if you're interested in something they can do for you. Everybody is doing that in real life, it's part of the game, they expect that. About the family business, it's way much touchy... As already said in answers to your previous question , dealing with your parents can be done either way: the one you're actually using, or another one (there's always \"another way\" I guess). Your call . No matter what they ask\/expect, it's your choice . Mine was to stand my ground up to my tolerance level. Once reached, I would stop calling\/answering\/visiting until the heat is off, and (almost) everyone had chilled out. It sometimes took years before I talk to some persons of my family. But family business is always different for every individual. I chose to stand my ground with always the same answer and argument. I chose not to answer their question when asked again and again. I chose to dodge the bullets anytime they would fire the same arguments. It is then your resilience. It didn't help that much for years, until time has done its office, and my resilience was \"the last man standing\". Did I do something wrong? I don't think so. I just didn't let them push until they \"win\" (for lack of a better word, as there's no winner in these tough family cases). So, to clear your points one by one (with a \"most probably\" warning ahead of each answer), and as I've witnessed\/suffered enough of these through decades: How do I stop people from repeating the same offer or request over and over again? -> you can't (unless you burn all bridges) How do I make them understand that their original offer or request is unacceptable to me, no matter how many times they repeat it? -> you can't (unless you burn all bridges) because what matters to them is them asking, not you answering. How do I make them take my reasons for refusal seriously? -> you can't (unless you burn all bridges) How do I get them to choose between engaging in a real discussion or negotiation and simply leaving me alone? -> you can't (unless you burn all bridges) As you can see, it's not something you can really control, it's human behaviour, and people expect you to modify your stance\/opinion.

{"comment_text":"Not everything in life is a negotiation. Not every time that I ask you for something am I willing to ask differently, or turn my \"please give me X\" into a \"please trade me X if I give you Y\" offering. Sometimes \"please give me X\" means \"I really want X and I hope you will give it to me\", nothing more, nothing less. I treat almost nothing as a negotiation. Someone asks me for something, I say \"sure!\" or \"no thankyou\" and that's that. They don't ask me over and over. When I say \"well I would but \" or \"no unless \" or \"only if \" they go on and on requesting the same thing without addressing my but , unless , or if . It's like they hear \"this decision isn't quite settled yet and you can change it if you say the right thing to me\". Why do they keep asking? The potential employer has a budget for a position, and believes you're a good fit for it. They will not (it is clear) change that budget. This doesn't oblige you to take the job, but understand: they don't have to come back with a higher salary, even if they could be sure you would take the job if they did. They have the budget they have. The parents desperately need help. They are not competent at navigating the medical decisions they need to make. They are probably not also super competent at parenting from your account of them. But they need help. So they are calling \"help!\". You are not obliged to help them any more than you are obliged to take a job that pays less than you are worth, but they, I am quite sure, do not understand why you will not help, and are not going to change their will to get that help even if you somehow got across to them that your position (demand?) is that they do so. Instead they remind you of your societal obligation and hope you will do \"your duty\". They have few other options. The person who wants to share a flat is probably similar. They want to live away from their current situation, but can't afford it and would like to save rent by sharing with someone. So they ask. They call \"help!\". They can't make you a better offer or otherwise persuade you. They hope you change your position over time, because hope is the only strategy they have in this situation. My advice to you is to stop treating these requests as the start of a negotiation where you say \"no\" or \"no, unless...\" or \"only if you...\" and each of these replies interchangeably results in the person improving their offer or moving towards your position. Instead, treat them as requests and reply accordingly. No thankyou I cannot do that because [half a sentence that does not contain any suggestion they can fix this] That doesn't work for me It's still no on that one, sorry Nothing has changed, I'm not going to do that Example for the job \"no thankyou, I prefer my current job to what you are offering.\" Example for the parents \"I cannot get wrapped up in the medical issues while we have unresolved emotional pain, my head does not work properly to do the work it would require while I'm being reminded of our issues.\" Example for the room-mate, \"no thankyou, but I will let you know if any of our mutual friends mention they might be available.\" On the matter of your parents, if you can actually do the medical stuff but want to make them change their minds, I recommend you do it. They clearly need your help and are doing it all wrong. They may never change their minds; if you're able to help them anyway that would be good. Sure, being competent and capable is exactly why they have told you they won't be helping you, and that's wrong of them, but that has happened and is over. If they were going to change it, they would have already. It's not a negotiating point or a bargaining chip. Set it aside and consider and \"am I actually capable of helping?\" If it's no, then it's no. Period. Not \"unless you change your will\" just no. If it's yes, then consider yes.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28770","post_title":"What am I doing wrong if people repeat their original offers and requests despite me declining them?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28770","timestamp":"2024-07-13T22:59:45","char_len":3893,"word_len":728,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I agree with the previous posters that you must distinguish what you can change from what you can't, and the distinctions between standard behaviors (recruiters) vs. family crises. But you can steer the conversation differently. If you once explained your motives, if people ignore them, they do not deserve to hear them again (but read below). One way to discourage people who annoy you is to seriously and unemotionally respond with the same thing and nothing else. E.g. \"I don't like it when you do this\". You can apply this to 1 and 3 (the friend) in a modified way. For instance, just re-forward your original reply, again and again. Eventually they will get it that the conversation has ended. Don't be defensive (explaining) but lead (ask them). It seems you may have done this already in examples 1 and 2, not sure how from your question? Example 1. Instead of your first reply, explanations, maybe counter offer, second time be brief \"offer me X\" with no explanation. Then they are on the spot. If they send the same offer again, you can send the same answer (adjusted for inflation). With the friend who wants to move with you \"find an apartment with 2 bathrooms\/2 separate entrances\" whatever your privacy requires. It does not matter if such an apartment does not exist or is not affordable; she is being absurd in ignoring your motives, you can be a bit too (never over the top, you want to de-escalate your disagreement and stay friends). The situation with your parents is far more painful and stressful and it's not sure that such a policy can fix it, but my suggestion, if you can do it, is this. You first explain (or explained) your motives and feelings. Afterwards what's left is to control the discussion and stay constructive. and positive inasmuch as possible. Can you propose something that's more fair to you? For example, assure your parents that your care for them and the brother is worth more than the money they will leave him? In any case, every time your point of view is ignored, return with your proposal, the same proposal. But be nice; for example, state that you love your family, but that you believe plan X is the best one. And stick with it. This way you leave the communication open, but you refuse the conversations where your point of view is not respected. In summary, you can't stop people from asking you the same thing, but you can stay polite and even nice, and in the same time effectively close the conversations you don't want to have.

{"comment_text":"When you say \"ethical reasons\" you are implying that you have made the right choice (morally correct choice). This has an inherent implication that every one else has made the wrong choice. The problem is that you do believe you have made the right choice. You're not trying to force that on other people. In fact, it appears that you are much more careful about that then most of us are on a day to day basis. So how do you communicate the truth as you understand it, without making everyone else feel that you are implying that they have made the \"wrong\" decision? Answer: Use humor. Be careful: you don't want to make the meat eater the butt of the joke, but rather make yourself the butt of the joke. Full disclaimer: I could not think of any jokes that fit this criteria. (But then, I'm not that funny of a guy.) Be more specific. Focus your explanation on you, and keep it as short as you can. For example: Eating another animal's body parts feels gross to me. I don't like the idea of an animal being killed for me to eat. These two examples focus on disgust and guilt which you feel. While most people don't agree with your choice, they will be able to empathize with those feelings of disgust or guilt, which should (cross your fingers) help them connect with you rather than feel resentful toward you.

{"comment_text":"This seems to be a common problem that vegans and vegetarians experience, so it is worth thinking about why people ask. Is it because: they actually care very much about your diet? Unlikely they think you are weird and it will be fun to bait you? Sadly, more likely they have an economic interest, through employment, background or investment in non-plant based foods? not impossible it somehow came up in conversation and people are conditioned to respond by expressing interest in the distinctive and defining things we learn about other people, so they asked without ever really caring? possibly the most likely They assume you want to tell them? trying to be polite They are considering making the same choice? actively wanting to know and share views Not all of those might merit the same response and it is not a comprehensive list of every possibility. I shan\u2019t try and address every one of them, but consider these as examples to demonstrate how it can be worth thinking about the motive force behind the question and how that affects your response. You have already identified that people don\u2019t react will to your current stock reply and people have explained in other answers how it can be viewed as a criticism of the person asking, but also it is a very conversationally \u2018closed\u2019 response. What sort of response can someone make to that? They feel they\u2019ve been shut down, rebuffed and rebuked, what do they say next\u2026 So, perhaps a response which is more conversationally open and inviting of a response would be helpful. Have you ever tried asking why they\u2019re asking ? Well, there\u2019s different ways I could answer that, which might depend on why you are curious. What makes you ask? That gives the other person something they can more safely react to which doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like as much of a challenge, and eases you both into a two-way conversation. If you really aren\u2019t so keen to get into a conversation about your food choices in casual situations, then you may want to look for responses which are less likely to be read as confrontational, but that still don\u2019t make it sound as if the subject is up for debate. Conversationally closed, but not confrontational. Perhaps something like: Peace of mind mainly. After all who needs to lose sleep over their dinner, right?

{"comment_text":"\"Why are you vegan?\" \"I like it.\" (Good alternative: LightnessRacesinOrbit proposed \"Because I want to\"). Rationale: Attempting to justify and explain yourself implies you are seeking the approval of your interlocutor, and this invites them to pass judgement\/evaluation on you. Even if you are enthusiastic about your reasons for being vegan, it still frames the discussion as them questioning you, and you attempting to prove yourself. This creates a hierarchy. Using the phrase \"ethical reasons\" also introduces morals into the discussion, sounds judgmental, and sort of invites conflict in a passive-aggressive way, as the other will feel compelled to prove they're just as ethical as you are. \"I like it\" on the other hand, moves the discussion towards the domain of subjective tastes, and defuses conflict. This also traps the other a bit, as seriously criticizing other people's tastes is generally considered rude. If the conversation goes on, consider lines like this (well, only if you would actually do that, of course): \"I'd eat eggs if they came from chicken I'd raise myself, so I could make sure they're happy. Thinking about battery cages ruins the taste for me.\" This is an I-sentence (you're expressing your tastes, and not attaching a moral value to them), and it also contains a concession to your interlocutor (you'd eat eggs if). Now, I've raised chicken in my backyard, so I know that turning a \"live chicken\" into a \"delicious roasted chicken\" involves a bit of gruesomeness, which the average person who buys chicken at the supermarket is very much eager to not know anything about. Not to mention what agribusiness is like. If you bring the conversation to moral grounds by saying \"ethical reasons\" then you will force them to consider where the chicken fillet at the supermarket actually comes from, and you're actually calling them out on their hypocrisy. They will react badly to this. Which is why \"I like it...\" sounds pretty good.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11739","post_title":"How do I answer the question &quot;why are you vegan?&quot; honestly, without making them resent me?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/11739","timestamp":"2018-03-13T16:26:05","char_len":1991,"word_len":322,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"The safest way is to relate your reasons to you directly, instead of making them so-called \"global truths\". For example, saying The treatment of animals in slaughterhouses is disgusting. can be taken to non-vegans as Anyone who supports slaughterhouses by eating meat is disgusting. Frankly, saying \" ethical reasons \" could potentially also imply to others that they are unethical for not following a similar lifestyle (which is where you might be getting the justification responses). Instead, focus on making your point by keeping it scoped in on yourself : It's just a personal preference. I like the idea of eating whole-foods more than the idea of harvesting animals or their byproducts. This dials it down to being just about you. \"I like A more than B\" is a structure that doesn't imply that anyone is wrong for still liking B, because you're just saying you prefer A so much more that you've chosen it as a lifestyle.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11739","post_title":"How do I answer the question &quot;why are you vegan?&quot; honestly, without making them resent me?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/11739","timestamp":"2018-03-13T16:26:05","char_len":959,"word_len":158,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I also minimize my consumption of animal products (though due to chronic health reasons, I am not 100% vegan), purely for ethical reasons, and live in an area where this is not common; so this is based off of my experience with the situation. Instead of saying \"I'm vegan for ethical reasons.\" which can get people defensive, I find the slightly modified statement \"I'm vegan because it aligns with my values.\" \/ \"Eating animal products doesn't align with my values.\" gets better responses. I think this is a good answer because it expresses that veganism is important to you and not just, for example, a preference for the taste of vegan food, but since values are taken as more personal than ethics it doesn't cause as much friction. Many people will leave it at that, because they're not really interested; they're just being polite. The people who do ask follow-up questions tend to be those who are actually interested, and less likely to be offended if you go into specifics. Of course, some people will manage to become offended no matter what you say. I would focus more attention on relationships with the people who take it in stride - they tend to be a lot more mature. The vast majority of my friends eat meat and though they don't plan on stopping, they will be sure to warn me if food they prepared has animal products, check for veg options when choosing a restaurant, etc. The people who look out for you, even if they don't have a personal stake in the matter, are your true friends. The ones who will give you grief about it tend to not be worth the trouble. (Sorry if it's too similar to other answers - but I could not find the same wording, specifically \"values\", and I feel that that has been the most important, yet simple, part of how I shifted the way I spoke about my veganism without minimizing it's importance to me.)","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11739","post_title":"How do I answer the question &quot;why are you vegan?&quot; honestly, without making them resent me?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/11739","timestamp":"2018-03-13T16:26:05","char_len":1876,"word_len":333,"lang":"en"}

Also people are not ideal autonomous agents. Instead they are influenced by people around them and media they consume. You might not have become a vegan if you hadn't watched those documentaries. Maybe you have done something else, not related to meat or animals, that could be considered morally wrong. Maybe you contributed to climate change by using a plane. Or you have let people down when they relied on you. Maybe the person you are talking to is not a vegan, but has other areas where they make an effort, like being really good parents, responsible car drivers, helping out in the neighborhood etc. In this spirit, you can say something like this: I watched too many icky documentaries about meat production, this destroyed my appetite for animal products. or From what I learned over time about how animals are kept and treated these days, I decided I don't want to do it anymore. I wanted to prove to myself that I can live without animal products. Now I don't even remember how it tastes like.

{"comment_text":"As a lifelong vegetarian I find giving a humorous answer, rather than a serious one is the first line of defense. My favorite is \"I'm not a vegetarian because I like animals, it's because I hate vegetables.\" This usually gets a chuckle, and conversation can move on to other things, as most of the time people are asking to be polite. The beauty of this is that if they really are interested, they have the opportunity to ask the \"real\" reason I'm a vegetarian at a later point, but if they're not (which is the case most of the time) I've effectively answered their question without answering it. If they do inquire further, how you frame your response can affect how it's received.

{"comment_text":"This question often arises when people who are not very closely acquainted sit together to eat, and the reasons for it may vary. You could give a specific but brief 'teaser' such as : I was convinced by the arguments of Animal Right Activists\/ Studies on the negative impact of the Meat Industry on the environment \/ any other option. If you eat in company in a setting when each person is responsible for bringing or ordering their food (for example in a workplace cafeteria) then the reason for the inquiry may be that the person is interested is your opinion on people who do eat meat or dairy products. The 'tongue-in-check' comment: \"you must think I'm awful for eating this burger, haha.\" even if not expressed politely is actually a valid concern of a person eating a meat burger in front of a vegan. I would start with setting them at ease and letting them know that you're not there to sit judgement over them for their dietary choices, for example by answering with some cliche, saying: \"No, not at all. Each for his own, it would be terribly boring world if we all had the same opinions.\" If that closes the subject, then the asker was probably not terribly curious about your motivations as for why you chose to be a vegan in the first place, merely was seeking reassurance that the person with whom they share a table is not repulsed by their meal of choice or silently judging them from their moral high ground. If the person persists in their inquiry you should expand on the subject if you wish, but only if they seem to be genuinely curious and open to a productive discussion. If the tone of the conversation becomes passive agressive, defensive or teasing, it's time to cut the conversation on the topic short repeating that opinions may differ and any approach is legitimate, and that you find it not constructive to judge someone on based on dietary choices whether they eat meat or not. Keep in mind that while you researched the subject at length and engrossed by it, your company may not be equally invested. Watch for signs of interest or lack of. Your company may not necessarily be ready to listen to lengthy discussions on the impact of meat production on the environment or the exact statistic of yearly factory livestock farming in your county.

Maybe they'd rather you be part of the gang and do what they do \u2014 you describe your problem as others who are confronting you, and not vice versa . Other answers provide various other similar motivations or interpretations which could produce the situations you encounter. The trick in all this is to remember that you probably aren't claiming to be a prophet who has seen the One Truth: you simply think that you have a way of interacting with the world\u2013at\u2013large which results in a yield of more good than of evil. You aren't trying to convert anybody else: you are simply willing to discuss the reasons why you have decided upon your own lifestyle. Of course, if you really think that your lifestyle does good, then you do believe that there are those lifestyles which do bad. However, though that could motivate you to speak out a little, it shouldn't drive you to be reckless. Oftentimes perception can be fooled by illusion; things which seem dire can be trivialized: one's lifestyle can do bad unbeknownst to them as much as others' lifestyles can do good which is similarly unnoticed.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"11739","post_title":"How do I answer the question &quot;why are you vegan?&quot; honestly, without making them resent me?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/11739","timestamp":"2018-03-13T16:26:05","char_len":1801,"word_len":308,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Sometimes being dismissive is the best way to handle this if you think the person is just trying to make smalltalk and doesn't want the full explanation. For example answers like \"Does it matter?\" or \"Because I am.\" can sometimes work. If a person is genuinely interested they'll press for a full answer in which case you can give your reasons. When you're giving your reasons make sure to mention that you generally don't like discussing it because other people seem to judge your decision to not eat meat despite the fact that you aren't judging them. Unfortunately a lot of non-vegans\/vegitarians are predisposed to assuming that vegans\/vegitarians are judging them or think they are better than non-vegans\/vegitarians despite that rarely being the case, so if you make it clear that you aren't then it shoots down their preconceptions before they have chance to get riled up for no good reason. If someone does get angry or annoyed for some reason you just calmly ask \"I'm sorry, is there a problem?\", which invites them to explain their annoyance. Once they have explained you can address their issues. Most likely it will be something along the lines of \"you think you're better than us\" or \"you're trying to impose your veganness on everyone else\", in which case the best way to shoot down those fallacies is to prompt the person for evidence, which they most likely won't be able to provide. If it's the first time they've found out that you're vegan, stress how long they've known you for without realising. On the other side of the coin, if they start trying to make jokes simply say \"I've heard that one before\" or \"That one wore thin by the time I was 12\" or something, preferably with a blank look on your face so they realise that such jokes aren't amusing.

{"comment_text":"No idea if this will even be seen by the OP in the massive volume of answers, but I thought I'd add a personal viewpoint of my own. I am speaking as someone who has never eaten meat (not the same thing as being Vegan, but my experiences are nonetheless similar). I mean ever. I will be 45 soon, and from what I've been told by family members I simply wouldn't touch meat as a baby or young child, period. I have no memory of this, but meat has simply never been food to me. I know it is to other people, but not me. I am also a total animal lover and will generally choose animal company over most humans, though I don't pass judgment on those who choose to eat meat. It's their choice, I just happen to make a different one. All that being said, I have been given endless grief of varying degrees about my choice not to eat meat (and many other things but that's outside this scope) my entire life. My family was not vegetarian and constantly worried about me, harassed me, bribed and blackmailed me... same with \"friends\", teachers, co-workers, you name it. I literally couldn't (and still can't) go out to eat with anyone who didn't already know me extremely well, without my food choices becoming the focus of conversation. The problem appears to be that people want a \"why\" to explain me, and there isn't one. Unlike the OP I don't have \"ethical reasons\". Nor do I have religious, political, health, or any other specific reason. Meat is simply inedible to me, period. It doesn't smell good, doesn't look good, nothing about it holds the slightest appeal to me whatsoever. But there is no singular \"why\" and people just can't deal with that. Finally I'm getting to my point for the OP. In my experience there is no way to accomplish what you want. Meat-eaters (making a huge generalization obviously but hey...) will never, ever, be able to get their head around it or see you as anything but weird. Basically there will be two camps of people in life - those who have some kind of problem with it, are uncomfortable with it, threatened by it, whatever... and those who simply do not care. I've been fortunate in that nearly all of my relationships have just happened to be with people in that latter camp (not intentional on my part, I just got incredibly lucky) so I have not had to deal with this crap from my significant others. But people outside of that, even some that I still talk to who have known me for many, many years, just don't get it and think of me as \"just weird\" or \"I don't eat\" etc. Kinda sucks but for me, I just choose to have very few people in my life and I really like it that way.

Following the same reasoning as before, this implies that you believe people which are not vegan think it is worth it. It is neutral, and they would probably agree with this assessment.

The ambiguity is almost intentional here - you can actually use it to strengthen the seriousness of your position. When it comes to eating, the hands are the last part of your body involved in the process that others should expect to be allowed to touch (eg as a handshake) without a clear invitation. While others can expect that you tolerate (you don't need to \"respect\", yo!) their choices in that regard - neither are your choices subject to anyone's judgement.

My answer is usually \"I never got into it, don't really like the taste or the effect. I know I could learn to like it, and there's a whole world of alcohol [in your case, meat] out there, but I just don't really feel like it.

Ethics are difficult, seriously difficult, and as others and yourself has said, if you're right, then they're wrong . I would go with something similar to: As far as I can tell, it is the ethical choice I think it is the ethical choice I am admittedly, and obviously, not a wordsmith, but here's why a variation of this might work. It allows the listener an out, where he\/she can still be ethical, by his\/her own standards. What is ethical is objective, but what you think is ethical is subjective. Furthermore, it opens the discussion up to inquiry. How so? How did you get to that conclusion? If I understand you correctly, you wouldn't mind a deeper discussion of the ethics involved, and in all likelihood, you end up all learning something. As a sidenote, it is possible that no answer will help to some people. The resentment does not come from you judging them, but from them putting you into the Liberal hippie potsmoker activist camp with all the other hippie vegans . The only cure to that is to let them get to know you.

There's a way to do it while being honest, expressing your values, and still not offending anyone but the easily-offended. Your best strategy is to craft a sentence that begins \" I just don't want to eat... \" My first suggestion is \"I just don't want to eat anything that probably came from an animal suffering.\" I imagine you can do better, but it's a decent starting point. As someone who does eat meat, that's a response I could respect, and understand easily that it does not carry an accusation with it (unless of course I worked for Perdue or Tyson). I'd probably respond with something beginning with a sincere \"good for you...\" The simple truth is that there's no way to be honest without making some people think uncomfortable thoughts, and that's okay. It's just how the world works. It would be the same if you were an activist working to increase ethnic and economic diversity in housing, for example: almost every neighborhood has a dominant ethnicity (or else a narrow economic demographic), and most people like their neighborhood without thinking about its lack of diversity.

{"comment_text":"I say that it's \"for all the reasons\". They've probably heard the reasons before and don't need to hear them again from me. This answer is especially appropriate if the question is phrased as \"either\/or\", e.g. \"Is it for health reasons, or etc.?\" FYI, various possible reasons include compassion, health, enjoyment, economics. ecology. Another answer is, \"Because I can be.\" Another answer (possibly the least pushy) is, \"Because my girlfriend decided to be.\" For what it's worth, my reasoning is: \"For all the reasons\" ... I guess the subtitle is, \"I know you weren't born yesterday and I suppose you've already heard about this. Especially when the question you asked was ... Why are you vegan? Is it for health reasons, ethics, the environment? Taste, aesthetics? ... then you know the reasons: and I can reply, 'for all the reasons (these reasons and more)'. It's a win-win IMO, i.e. doing it for any one reason incurs the benefits of the other reasons too. Maybe people have lectured you on this topic in the past, and you don't need to hear it again from me. I decided there are good and sufficient reasons, by the way, but I don't need to lecture you (which I'd fear you might \"resent\"), and you don't need to pigeon-hole me (as a \"health nut\" or whatever). Being vegetarian or vegan is normal these days -- is it remarkable? If you want to know something specific (about the reasoning) then you can ask (because I might know something about all the reasons -- I too have heard the arguments before). Also the question as phrased (i.e. \"why are you vegan\") is all about me, and I'm not sure I'm quite comfortable with that (maybe I don't want a conversation with you that's all about me ). If you wanted to reply with any question about being vegan, you could. I'm not even personally very interested any more in my being vegan: it's just what I eat, to live, like everyone else. Also I don't want to hear the tired counter-arguments for not being vegan, so I don't want to prompt that with pro-vegan talking points.\" \"Because I can be\" ... is subtitled, \"If I were living in another time and place, then maybe I couldn't afford to be vegan, maybe I'd be unable to live that way -- if I were living in the Middle Ages, for example, or in the Arctic. So I realise I'm fortunate, that I'm able to be, here. I don't want to count myself as \"holier than thou\" for doing this, just luck that I have the opportunity (e.g. an environment where the foodstuffs are available) and the know-how.\" ... and, this goes without saying, \"You could be vegan too if you wanted be.\" \"Because my girlfriend decided to be\" ... subtitled, \"Big joke: I'm not a militant or anything (or at least, I'm not any more), just trying to please her -- like who wouldn't in my situation? One of those jokes in the internet is ... My wife wanted a kitten: but I'm the man in this house. So, we got a kitten. ... perhaps you understand. Of course we can be vegan if she wants us to be, we simply have to shop accordingly. My sweetheart says she likes animals. Love, eh?

I-messages are often used with the intent to be assertive without putting the listener on the defensive ... which have been recommended for \"conflict resolution\", and which may be appropriate since the question as phrased is especially asking about \"you\". I know that people argue about it, and people have taken this topic personally, I doubt it's worth lecturing people (if you want people to try some vegan meals there may be better ways than lecturing them), so I think you're right to worry that your answer might make people \"resent\" you. For that reason the first answer is more-or-less evading the question. Maybe it's inept or could be epter, but I have said exactly\/only that in the past and I don't remember its leading to arguments (maybe a lull in the conversation).

{"comment_text":"Your friend is probably not really lying, at least not primarily to you. This sounds like a case of her not being truthful to herself first and foremost. I would assume that she would honestly like the things she says to you to be true (that she's not into relationships right now, that the thing with her ex is over, etc.), but evidently they are not. In other words, she probably believes what she tells you when she tells it to you - but then things change when he texts or calls. If you want to be her friend, the best thing you can do is probably to have an honest conversation about what is going on in her love life. Happy people typically don't flip-flop between \"I am so over this\" and \"he is coming to my place in an hour so you need to get out\". What you can do as a friend is help her come to understand her own emotions - maybe, even likely, she isn't quite over this guy, and that's fine, but she should understand how she feels so that she can make informed decisions. As Legisey says, it's important to not judge her for her emotions (it's ok to still have feelings for somebody, even if these feelings led her to heartbreak before), but that does not necessarily mean that the best course of action is to jump right back into a relationship. Alternating between \"I hate that guy\" and one-night stands is probably even worse. These are things that you as a friend can help her talk through (but keep in mind that at the end of the day it's not about you - if she tells you she will not see him again only to hook up with him the next day, she isn't doing this to spite you!). Of course, there is also the alternate possibility that, at least from her side, your relationship isn't quite platonic, and that's why she wants to convince you that she is in fact single and (almost) available. We random people on the Internet can't figure this out for you, but it's certainly a possibility to consider if she does not want to talk about her ex to specifically you.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"18731","post_title":"Politely ask a female friend to stop lying to me about her relationship","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/18731","timestamp":"2018-09-24T04:46:15","char_len":1986,"word_len":376,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"TLDR : Focus your conversations on the implications of her accident on your relationship, not just your part of it. I intended to comment, but had to create a new anonymous profile for data privacy reasons, hence I can't. After typing the answer, I realized it might be seen as a frame challenge since a lot of it is about how to handle the situation and not about the specific conversation you are asking about. I'll still post it since I think it deals a lot with how to communicate. I was in a comparable situation in the sense that I was recently diagnosed with an incurable disease that will make me lose control over my legs and potentially other limbs over the next years. I also had extensive talks with my now ex-partner over this, so I feel I can offer some kind of insights. Since you mentioned that you only want to break up as a last resort if there is no alternative to you being her primary caretaker, I would build up the conversation to this end. Talk to her honestly and constructively about how her life (and, by extension, yours) will change, what help she will need and what support systems there are. This will organically include talking about the kind (and amount) of support that you would be able to (or would have to) give her. At this point, you should be honest about what you are willing to do. This way, you can plan around your capabilities as well as her needs. Here, try not to flood the conversation with negative scenarios. Let her know that you ultimtely want to help her, and are having this conversation as a first step to figure out how the two of you can find a solution that you are both okay with. Be clear about your boundaries and explain how the additional strain on you will not only affect your mood, work and energy, but also in extension your relationship. If she can understand your view, you can ideally reach a conclusion about the future of your relationship together that you both see as reasonable, if potentially sad. This conversation can show her that you are trying to support her and are still serious about making the relationship work. This should also help you to identify if the additional strain on you is actually as hard as you think it would be. I don't know the specifics of your situation and don't know if the two of you already put exhaustive research into her needs, your capabilities and additional support systems. If not, a decent part of your doubts might be based on negative visualization and conjecture. Having such a conversation requires a certain emotional distance from the issue. Depending on how long in the past the accident occurred, it might be a good idea to wait for some time until the initial shock of the life-changing event has settled. EDIT To answer OP's comment: In my specific situation, the topic of breaking up was reached dynamically by talking (and mostly thinking) about the aforementioned issues. It was ultimately her who explicitly stated the possibility of breaking up over it when we talked about the things we wanted from life and what would be possible for me in the future. It didn't feel very crass because I already had these thoughts on my mind, and it seemed like a reasonable, yet sad, option. I don't know you or your girlfriend, but I would imagine the thought of her disability impacting your relationship has crossed her mind, too. If you want to emphasize that you love her and don't want to offend or devalue her, show her that you didn't just make up your mind when you knew she would be more work but that you gave it a lot of thought and there's simply no realistic possibility in which you're both happy. If you didn't already have a long conversation about how her life will continue with her disability, giving her some time after having that conversation will probably help her to understand before you go for a breakup. Finally, I just want to express my sympathies for the both of you. My answer might read like I'm trying to convince you to forget your doubts and stay on. That's not the case. I understand you have a tough conversation ahead and breaking up is a completely understandable reaction. All the best.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28839","post_title":"How do I communicate gently with my girlfriend about caretaking stress and relationship reservations after a life changing diagnosis?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28839","timestamp":"2024-09-04T05:09:44","char_len":4174,"word_len":745,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"TL;DR Yes. Here's one interesting study that actually set out to see if they could reproduce the finding of a previous fraudulent study... You gotta love science, after peer review. ... volunteers from the Los Angeles LGBT Center and SAVE, a Florida LGBT organization asked voters what they thought about the recent law? [protecting trans rights] Would they watch this video and talk about their reactions? Could they talk about a time when they had been on the receiving end of negative judgment or stigma? Did that help them to understand what a transgender life is like? Did that change their views? It was a deliberate strategy, and it worked\u2014durably and dramatically. These ten-minute conversations, known as \u201cdeep canvassing,\u201d substantially reduced prejudice against transgender people for at least three months, even in the face of anti-transgender ad campaigns. Not all the voters were swayed, but on average, they experienced a drop in transphobia greater than the fall in homophobia among average Americans from 1998 to 2012. The canvassers, through ten-minute chats, had produced the equivalent of 14 years of social change. No, Wait, Short Conversations Really Can Reduce Prejudice Same story covered by NPR: Study Finds Deep Conversations Can Reduce Transgender Prejudice The emphasis was mine, but I suspect that it may be the key to helping people get over some of their prejudices regarding taboo and formerly taboo issues. It's not just talking about it, but how you talk about it. Most people have been stigmatised, ridiculed, or discriminated against for something at some point in their lives. If you can get people to remember that feeling and then coax them towards understanding that other people feel that way because of X, then there's a chance that you can get them feel some sympathy and maybe even a little empathy. Anecdotally I can sort of confirm these findings through personal experience. It's one thing to have ideas about a group of people or an issue, but it's another thing to actually sit and talk with someone directly effected by those ideas. I've dealt with a pretty good handful of people who were openly phobic until they got to know me, many of them came around eventually. Also... I notice that people around me have grown accustomed to my eccentricity, I regularly talk about \"taboo\" subjects and they rarely\/never seem shocked or unsettled when I bring up issues of sexuality, gender, foul language, divisive politics, or PHP so there might be something to be said for desensitizing through exposure. Unfortunately I couldn't find a study on that...","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"4669","post_title":"Does talking about mildly taboo topics with people normalize the subject for them?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4669","timestamp":"2017-09-27T23:38:45","char_len":2634,"word_len":427,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"The article you quoted mentioned 'discussing' taboo topics. The article mentions talking about them more but doesn't say whether such discussions actually cause any change in people's perceptions of the topics. But your question body suggests you just 'mention' them. Do studies show that mentioning a \"taboo\" topic to someone has a \"normalizing\" effect in relation to that topic on those people? You were right stating this about the article: I think it's really focusing on actual conversations. From what I read in your question, you're not 'discussing' the breastfeeding with your colleagues, but you only mention it in passing when you're going to do it. For me, there's a significant difference between 'discussing\/talking about' and 'mentioning' a topic. So for the sake of this answer, I'm working from the premise that you are having an actual talk\/discussion about a taboo subject because that's the part I think that can be answered. I'd like you to take a look at this web comic . No really, read it. It does a really good job at explaining 'the backfire effect'. This effect is the explanation for 'why' people feel uncomfortable when you discuss topics with them that are taboo (for them), and it's also of huge importance as an answer to whether such discussions actually cause any change in people's perceptions of the topics , the answer being that it's very dependent on the person with which these things are discussed. From the dictionary: A taboo is a vehement prohibition of an action based on the belief that such behavior is either too sacred or too accursed for ordinary individuals to undertake. So basically, when trying to normalise the discussion of a taboo topic, you're challenging somebodies belief that that specific topic shouldn't be discussed, at all. That's a difficult thing to do. Because of the backfire effect, openly challenging an idea (that you shouldn't discuss things) might actually confirm for those people the idea that this is exactly something that shouldn't be discussed. Based on a list of sources I have read: this website , mentioning that cancer is now a lot less stigmatised than before. this article , about the backfire effect and how understanding it can help you. this webpage , more information about the backfire effect, also in relation to 'taboo' topics like stem-cell research. this abstract , about political misconceptions, information and backfire effect. this web page , stating that weaker arguments are more likely to change a persons mind. the first page of this article , encouraging discussing menstruation in the classroom. this article about the positive effects of discussing sex with an older generation. I've made the following conclusions: I've found no evidence that casually mentioning taboo topics alone (I'm going to breastfeed, I'm having a period, I'm homosexual) makes these topics any less taboo to discuss for people. Mentioning it gives a signal that you are up to further discussing the topic, although the people for whom the topic is an absolute taboo aren't very likely to come and discuss it further with you. They might even go into defensive mode as a result of a backfire effect, and use it to further build up their own views. You might spark curiosity by making statements about taboo topics. If people are even slightly interested, it's nice to know that there's somebody there with whom they can discuss things. That there's a person there to answer all the awkward questions, and speak from experience. But this requires a 'willing to learn' attitude from the other person. If you're going to have a real talk\/discussion about a taboo topic and you want to change a person's perspective of that topic, a lot depends on how you discuss the topic AND how open the other person is to changing their perception, but if these are both present, it will certainly help in normalising the topic Do studies show that mentioning a \"taboo\" topic to someone has a \"normalizing\" effect in relation to that topic on those people? If it does, I'm happy to continue but if it doesn't, it may be better to stop risking making my friends and coworkers uncomfortable. I'd say the benefits outweigh the risks on this point. You're making a statement that you're ready to discuss these things people, when they are ready. If you're making people very uncomfortable, they will show\/tell you. And even that opens up a conversation in which you can explain why you aren't uncomfortable mentioning the topic. So, after the research I have done, I'd say just continue what you're doing, until you're asked to do otherwise, then respect that person wishes if you can.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"4669","post_title":"Does talking about mildly taboo topics with people normalize the subject for them?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4669","timestamp":"2017-09-27T23:38:45","char_len":4734,"word_len":778,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Reading the example taboo topic of breastfeeding made me want to share how breastfeeding and the inability to breastfeed affected my family. That isn't the question, but it would be public evidence of normalization. Someone else might have read the same example and thought, \"that kind of thing shouldn't be discussed in public\" Which would have been evidence against normalization if the thought were known. But it is the nature of a taboo that it isn't discussed, and when it is discussed, people tend to characterize their comments in the most PC way, which makes an accurate study on the topic problematic. In order to understand what type of study we are looking for, we first need to define what it means to normalize a topic for someone. That is up to @Catija, but it appears from context that for her, normalize would mean that she could discuss breastfeeding with a coworker, without that coworker feeling uncomfortable about it. I think she would view that as a positive result. Intuitively, her joking mentions of the topic signal that someone in the office is comfortable discussing the topic. That is most likely to invite further discussion. For example, a male coworker previously shy about the topic may be emboldened to ask you(as the defacto expert) \"If a woman is breastfeeding in public, is it ok to look?\" Is that still a positive result? The joking could make some momentarily slightly uncomfortable, even to the extent that someone makes a conscious choice to avoid discussing it, but I find that unlikely, even less likely that such person would ever make that decision known. Therefore we are looking for a study that concludes mentioning a taboo topic makes it less taboo.

This is a good approach, but I don't believe your current wording does this. I've been thinking about some of the stuff you've said recently, reading between the lines, and I feel like I've been intentionally led on. This document on \"I Statements\" says: An \u201cI-statement\u201d focuses on your own feelings and experiences. It does not focus on your perspective of what the other person has done or failed to do But how you are expressing it currently very much focusses on what you think the other person has done (deliberately led you on) Instead you could say something like: The way you behaved made me feel you had changed your mind\" or \"...you weren't serious about being casual. Of course, this means you are being less accusatory (that's the point!) which may not be what you want. It sounds at the moment like you want to accuse her of leading you on and her not be able to argue back, but I don' think that's realistic when you make an accusation.

I used the statement in my question, she said she understands, and added that she had been meaning to clear the air. She apologized for being unclear with her intentions, especially in the last month, and ended her response by saying she was not trying to toy with my emotions. For other readers who may be in similar situations, I am glad I reflected on this beforehand, for two reasons. First, I did not allow the original pain I felt guide my choice of words to extremes, as romantic feelings can do. Secondly, since I had processed my pain and empathized with her situation, in the moment I was ready to forgive her, and pre-meditating helped me remember that her situation does not excuse her actions, and holding a boundary will be healthier in the long run.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28755","post_title":"How to gently but firmly approach someone about leading me on","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28755","timestamp":"2024-06-30T10:08:49","char_len":879,"word_len":157,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"How can I learn to just shut up and not be driven to correct everything all the time? A willingness to correct others is not wrong an sich , but it becomes very annoying very quickly when done wrong. If you can manage to learn how to do it right, it turns into leadership. Being a leader is good, being an insufferable know-it-all is bad. What I'm seeing from the examples in your question, is somebody who is honestly trying to help but just lacking a bit of tact for doing it right. Shutting up when something is bothering you, can be one of the most difficult things to do. What helped me was having good guidance during my early childhood, my mom and dad corrected my behaviour often. What they taught me was: It's okay to correct somebody, but only if the correction isn't over something minor. Being corrected often results in an amount of embarrassment for the person being corrected. Think before you speak is a hard thing to do, but really the only way to learn to shut up when necessary. If I correct this mistake, will I only embarrass the other person, or is he\/she e.g. doing something that can result in danger when not corrected? Do we really need this canopy to be up as soon as possible, or can we just take the time and have fun doing it? Mind how you phrase your correction. For your first example, the garage sale, you shouldn't order your brother around, but it's better to ask this. If there really was a time pressure on raising the canopy, instead of saying \"Do this, do that\", you actually ask something like: Hey [brother], I think we can get this done a lot quicker if you started on that pole, while I do this one. Shall we give it a try? You don't have to correct somebody right away, especially not in public. Sometimes, it is better to later offer a correction privately. You might be surprised, that in some cases the other person has already realised their mistake. Correcting later has 2 advantages: you are not humiliating the person in public, and you are possibly saving them from more embarrassment later on. Don't be offended when somebody doesn't want to be corrected. Don't take that personal. If your correction was offered in a humble, sincere way, there is nothing you could have done better and the other person just needs to learn on their own. Maybe they will realise later that you were right all along. Then it is important to remain humble. No saying \"I told you so!\". As for the situation with your mom, this is a classic example of 'how to phrase your correction'. Don't use sarcastic humour to try and correct somebody. It may be seen as making a joke at the others expense. If you want to address this in public, it's better to ask something like: But mom, we are all ready to start watching the show. Can you do it after the show, so we won't have to wait for it now? Making it a question already makes it feel a lot less like a correction, but more like a concern from your part. If your mom says no, well, she is still your mom, so at that point, you just give in. You settle down on the couch, and wait until she is back from counting the money. Since wanting to count money before starting to watch a show is not a life-threatening behaviour, just leave her to do so. There's no need to start an argument over it.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"3654","post_title":"How to stop constantly correcting everyone and everything?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/3654","timestamp":"2017-09-10T04:30:41","char_len":3323,"word_len":609,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"How to overcome a severely chronic case of pedantry? Answer(and not an easy one to do): You have to internalize that being precise and technically correct about things is only of limited value. You need to find a way to be okay about things that are \"wrong\" but \"close enough\". Human life is messy. It isn't really the speaking up that you do that is \"the problem\". It is merely a symptom. You \"know\" how things should go. When you see others being imprecise, you want to \"help\" them by telling them how to do it correctly. Your help annoys them. Can't they see you are trying to help? I'm going to say the following thing twice: You're intent doesn't matter. You're intent doesn't matter. (Yes. I know it is \"your\". I picked \"you're\" to make a point here.) But isn't it the thought that counts? That's what we've been told. Nope. The perception of the other person is the message that is received. Maybe your mother had an anxiety that could only be assuaged by counting the money. Perhaps she would not have been able to enjoy the TV show without knowing this. Maybe thoughts about it would be circling her brain over and over until she went and checked. I used to correct people's grammar, chiefly by saying \"-ly\" when someone used an adjective as an adverb. I figured people wanted to use English correctly, and so I was helping. Everyone was just annoyed, because I was being deliberately technical and I should \"know what they meant\", and they felt I was \"calling them dumb\". And you know what? That is precisely what I was doing, because they perceived it that way. No, it wasn't my intent, but as I've said... that doesn't matter. I've switch my perception, because you know what? The very existence of adverbs in a language is silly. What is the difference if a person says \"I am doing good\" or \"I am doing well\"? Can I determine the same meaning from either? Yes. Did communication take place? Yes. Is that good enough? Yes.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"3654","post_title":"How to stop constantly correcting everyone and everything?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/3654","timestamp":"2017-09-10T04:30:41","char_len":1961,"word_len":350,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Being around an insufferable know-it-all is one of the most annoying things to ever experience. And, trust me, I used to be one myself... A few years ago, I used to act like I knew everything (something that commonly happens to most teens...) and used to correct every minor mistake in each and every person's business, which usually didn't even concern me. If anyone made any mistake, I would feel like \"Oh my God, that guy's got his basics wrong... I gotta correct him before he goes and ruins his reputation\". I was too concerned with other people and the \"correctness of things\"... With time, my friends began to desert me, and I began to ask myself, what was I doing wrong? By asking a few friends and my parents, I realised that the only mistake I was making was that I was correcting other people's mistakes... I decided to change myself. Now the big question: How? That answer also came to me soon enough. I realised that if constantly correcting other people (due to me caring too much about them and the correctness of things), I was alienating them from me, then perhaps, if I cared a little less, and corrected them only when it was absolutely necessary, maybe, just maybe, they would realise the significance of my telling them? Two years down the line, I became the head boy of my school, because my classmates and my teachers had voted me in. Turns out, caring less actually appears as caring more to most people, and caring too much is generally perceived as a person trying to embarrass others...

{"comment_text":"I don't know if this will work for you. But for a young person who had very rigid right-and-wrong-way-to-do-things opinions, a piece of paper and a pencil in the pocket cured it. When someone does something wrong, make a note of it. Tell yourself you will discuss it with them later, when no-one else is around or when the emotion or pressure of the situation is lower. Tell yourself you will run it by a trusted advisor before raising it with the person who \"did it wrong.\" Let them do it wrong, and make a note. You may find that within minutes you can happily throw the note away. You may find it useful to run through a pocketful of notes with a trusted friend or parent. You may end up using the notes to extract your real issue, your reason for needing to correct them and believing they were wrong. Imagine telling someone simply and honestly \"I felt unimportant when instead of watching a show I was looking forward to as a reward for a day's work, I had to wait for you when you decided there was still some work left in the day. It made me tense. I felt I couldn't control my opportunity to relax.\" That's useful insight anyone who shares a home with you would be happy to hear. Of course, you may realize as you formulate the sentence that your conclusion \"my part of the garage sale is done!

{"comment_text":"They could be delaying for a few reasons: They just forgot. They legit didn't have time. There's some logistical thing on their end that could be a deciding factor and they left you hanging because they didn't realize it would be so long to find out They really don't want to for whatever reason-- maybe they've just been super stressed and get stressed out by house guests-- but don't have a \"solid\" excuse, and don't know how to say no. They're dealing with severe depression, social anxiety or an executive functioning problem of some sort and have a hard time initiating tasks like that. Here are my assumptions: You need an answer soon You're worried about being a pest You're worried that you're pressuring them into saying yes You don't want to damage your friendship by seeming judgemental about their flakiness, having no insight into why that's true. I reckon friends always deserve the most charitable reading of their actions. You want to make this conversational rather than confrontational. For example, when you encounter someone you see infrequently where one of you says something like \"hey we still need to get coffee sometime! Text me!\" but you're both busy and it just never happens... the actual coffee date is secondary to conveying a certain level of intimacy in a friendship, and the desire to maintain that even if there's no realistic logistical way to make it happen. But you can express nearly the same lingual thing while making it more confrontational. If one of you said, \"It's great to see you! The last time we hung out I said we should get coffee sometime and you didn't reach out to me. So please figure out an appropriate time for us to get coffee and let me know as soon as possible.\" There might not be anything factually incorrect about that, but it certainly puts a whole lot of pressure on them, and that's just not great for a friendship. I'd write something like this: Hello! I hate being a pest, but I have to figure out where I'm staying for my trip by [frisday january 62nd] at the latest. Booking a hotel room is no big deal, but I thought it would be nice to connect while saving some cash. It's no big deal for me to book a room, but the sooner I know, the better. I'll just assume it's not going to work out if I don't hear from you by [Tuesturday january 58th]. Either way, we should grab a [drink\/bite\/coffee\/mini golf] while I'm in town! Thank you! You convey: You're uncomfortable and feel like you're intruding, and their reply would relieve that tension. You do have options and are not pressuring them to say yes. You have a logistical deadline. The problem becomes more difficult to handle the longer they take to reply. and perhaps most importantly: No matter what happens, they're still your friend and their being flaky here isn't going to change that. Even if you don't think you'll be able to, making the gesture is important-- just cancel early if that's true. \"Sorry, I found out that the after-event networking at this conference is really useful, so I should probably do that. Next time I'm in town, though!\" As for the phone call suggestion, that is extremely generation-dependent. Millennials and younger, on a whole, hate unexpected phone calls. Gen-X and above usually don't mind. If you grew up getting phone calls, as I did, it's just a normal, accepted type of communication. If you didn't grow up getting phone calls, they're not much different than someone walking up to you without caring what you're doing and demanding you stop and talk to them immediately. If this person is younger than 40, the only truly non-intrusive way to do that would be asking them to call you, but that's probably going to yield a worse result than some sort of text-based message.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"9162","post_title":"How to nicely remind someone to reply to an important message without being rude?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/9162","timestamp":"2018-01-15T08:49:06","char_len":3798,"word_len":657,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I completely understand your problem. I'd say I've experienced worse in the form of parents being utterly uncaring of the people around them. I still haven't seen the second half of Mamma Mia because of a mid-day screening I tried to go to with at a theater with only myself and a group of two women and four or five kids, two of which were playing with strobing light up toys in the aisles during the film. The only solution I had then was to leave and get my money refunded. You're right. Most theaters (unless they're scanning the audience on occasion for video recording devices) don't have staff checking in on the film and audience during the screening. So, what is a person who wants to enjoy a film in peace to do? First, there is (in most of the major chains I attend) a real movement towards respectful movie-watching. Many theaters have pre-show notices or videos telling the audience not to talk, or text and to turn off their phones during the screening. Hopefully, if this continues, these parents will realize that curbing their child's (loud) excited exclamations is appreciated by the audience. There are a couple of solutions. I'm listing even ones you have set aside here for completeness... I like to put them in two categories because I find that, often, the solution is to avoid or try to minimize the chance of there being a problem at all rather than solving a problem that is already there. Reactionary: You can (potentially) disrupt the film further for the rest of the audience by attempting to get the parents to quiet down their kids. You can leave temporarily (risk missing part of the film) and ask management to address it, which has the same issue of disrupting the film, possibly worse than if you did it yourself. You can leave the theater and ask for a refund, opting to see the movie another day\/time. This has the risk of recurrence, though the \"proactive\" section below can limit that. If the theater's not too crowded you can move to a different seat. Depending on how loud the child is and how sensitive to this you are, YMMV. Tough it out and ask for a refund afterwards. Ask the theater to check in more often for disruptive audiences. Proactive: These are things that you can do to limit the chance of this happening. They aren't 100% and they require that you limit when\/where you see films but if seeing the film with a chatty kid will ruin it for you, one of these may be your best solutions. Find a theater that has fewer children attending. We have two theaters near us. One of them attracts lots of large families, the other doesn't. We stopped attending the theater with all the kids because of the example in my first paragraph. My movie-going experience has improved since then. See a screening at a time kids are less likely to be in the audience. After 8 on a Friday or Saturday or after 6 on a weekday. Yes, you have to pay more because these aren't matinee prices but many chains near me don't really do matinee pricing much any more, sometime only the first screening of the day. Find a theater chain that has staff in the theater at all times (or most of the time). Here in Austin we have the Alamo Drafthouse , which has table service in the theaters. They're not everywhere quite yet but they are awesome and expanding all over. Dinner and a show all in one go and the ticket price isn't marked up because they make tons of money on food. There are other similar chains that are around, too, like iPic . I hope that, eventually, everyone will follow proper cinema etiquette and keep quiet in a theater but, until then, I hope that you can find some relief using these suggestions.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"2494","post_title":"How do I deal with other people&#39;s children talking during the movies?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/2494","timestamp":"2017-08-25T00:52:36","char_len":3686,"word_len":660,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"If they are at least 5+, hushing them with a loud \"Shhhhhh\" may do the trick. You are directly addressing the issue instead of avoiding it, you are very mildly embarrassing the kids by calling them out to those around you (the kids themselves and the other audience members are very likely already cognizant of the kids' rudeness), and signals to the parents to keep their children under control, also embarrasing the parents mildly. The kids are more likely to react to embarrasment than parents if the parents haven't already been acting on the situation. A counter action by them is likely to solicit additional reaction from those around you to aid in pressuring them into silence or getting them ejected.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"2494","post_title":"How do I deal with other people&#39;s children talking during the movies?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/2494","timestamp":"2017-08-25T00:52:36","char_len":713,"word_len":121,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Since you said that moving to another seat or complaining to theatre staff\/ management is not an option, this question is challenging indeed. Strictly speaking, it is the parents' task to see that their children do not create a disturbance for other movie-goers, and the theatre management ought to ensure this. Assuming that the children are accompanied by at least one parent, you can request the parent to exchange seats such that the parents\/ parent is between you and the children -- if there are 2 parents it will make it much quieter even though the children are talking 2 seats away. It's my experience that many parents will ignore your request. However, an obliging parent might make the seat-shuffle to mitigate their children's disturbance, so it's worth making the request. If the parent refuses to help you then the only thing to do is to focus on the movie and endure\/ try to tune out the chatter. Direct action: if the parents allow it, you could spare a minute to buy 4 bags of popcorn and give them a bag each. It will keep them quiet till the popcorn is finished. It is also my experience that children tend to become quieter after eating food. Try this out next time!

{"comment_text":"I have done this twice now (I'm not a bad person, I promise!), mainly because I like to be a decent person. Part of that is that you sometimes realise that some behaviour\/remark you expressed a while ago, wasn't the best of plans. It's a part of developing :) My aproach is to keep it as simple as possible, I find that way its easier to bring it up. If I come up with some elaborate complex plan to talk, making sure everything is perfect, I know I won't bring it up when I want to, but when its simple its easier to start the conversation. Hey X, I know it has been a while, but I'd like to apologize for {EVENT}. I scolded at you while you were actually correct, I should not have done that. So my apologies. Doesn't have to be more than that, stick to the minimum. They will respond to you and from that point the conversation will continue. Either good or bad. Just because you said you're sorry, doesnt mean its OK for them! It might take a while or not happen at all. In both my situations the other person was surprised and then appreciative. One told me she had a lot of resentment towards me for {Behaviour} and that resentment disappeared over night :) There is a significant part two to this aproach: Don't do it again . The apology only works if you actually mean it. If you do it again, it ment nothing. But as the current situation is bothering you, I'm assuming you already try not to. Some examples: Hey X, I just wanted to apologize for {Event}. Looking back at it, I didnt handle that correctly, sorry. Hey X, In retrospect I noticed {action} wasn't very respectful, I did not mean to, apologies. Hey X, I'd like to say I dont think I was as suportive as I should've been.

{"comment_text":"Is this the right approach to get him to make less of those comments? If not what would be a better approach? In general, I would caution that it is extremely difficult to get a person who makes mean comments to make less of those comments when he is getting positive reinforcement from people around him. I see three major approaches to getting him to make less of those comments, and none of them are guaranteed (or perhaps even likely) to work: You could approach him one-on-one and explain why his comments are hurtful. If he is an empathetic person, this may cause him to change his behavior. However, given that he has been making hurtful comments in the first place, there is a good chance that he lacks to ability or willingness to empathize with those he is hurting, in which case you won't be able to influence him by appealing to empathy. This approach could also have the side effect of making him more aggressive towards you, since you would be expressing disapproval towards him. You could shame him in front of the group for his mean comments by calling him out in a way that is embarrassing for him. This would be fighting fire with fire, and in my experience this can work with aggressive types who only respond to what they perceive as 'strength'. But to do this, you have to be willing to have an altercation, and you shouldn't do that unless you are both very confident in ability to handle that confrontation and trust that people in the group will be on your side. You could approach others in the group and discuss your concerns. If they share your concerns, this could motivate them to join you in calling him out and shutting him down when he makes mean comments. Sometimes people are reluctant to stand up to someone simply because they aren't sure if others will back them up and they don't want to attract the meanness towards themselves. But if they know that they aren't alone, they will be more willing to stand up to him. If he starts to feel that the group is not approving of his comments, that may be enough to change his behavior. Of course, it is possible that others really do not share your concerns, and they might dismiss you by saying things like \"he's just kidding\" or \"you need to learn how to take a joke\". In that case, you are on your own. If none of these options seem promising (and it is hard to tell without having a nuanced feel for the personalities and social dynamics involved), then it could be that you simply need to accept the fact that this guy makes mean comments, and that your friends find it funny. If you can't accept that, then you need to find new friends. Bonus Points if you can explain to me why otherwise good people think he is funny in the first place. Based on the examples you provided, his mean comments are not witty or clever, they are just plain aggressive. Since you describe your friends as \"otherwise good people\", I am going to assume that they are not simply mean-spirited types who enjoy seeing someone being hurt, belittled, etc. In that case, I think it is very likely that their laughter is a matter of self protection: they see an aggressive person who likes to throw darts at others for attention, and their first thought is \"Gosh I don't want those darts to be thrown at me\", so they respond in a way that lets the bully know \"Hey I'm on YOUR side! So don't look at me!\". It is a social survival instinct- keep the bully from attacking you by supporting him when he attacks someone else. Many times, the same people who do this will still feel pangs of empathy for the person who is being attacked, but those pangs aren't enough to override the self-preservation instinct.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"1489","post_title":"How do I deal with someone people think is funny, but I think is mean?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/1489","timestamp":"2017-08-08T13:49:21","char_len":3694,"word_len":669,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"A couple of thoughts: Why keep inviting this guy to events (or letting him tag along)? He sounds really awful, so I might minimize his toxicity by just not letting him come along whenever possible. I think your instincts are right on for saying, \"Wow...\" or \"Wow, that's really mean!\" or even just giving him a nasty look whenever he says something. Honestly, I don't think that you're the problem so much as are the other \"nice people\" who are laughing at his jokes. They're encouraging him and letting him know that it's okay to disparage other people. Assuming that you think these people are genuinely good (not jerks like jerk-face), I'd pull people privately aside and say, \"Hey, I noticed that you laughed when jerk-face called nice-girl fat. I thought that was really mean and was wondering if you could not do it next time.\" Hopefully they agree that it was mean. (If not, they're not nice people.) And hopefully they agree that next time jerk-face makes a mean comment, he's met with stony silence from everyone. (As well as fewer invites.) Again, I think the main problem is that the group is allowing this behavior. But if jerk-face is consistently met with stony silence or someone saying, \"Wow, that was really mean jerk-face!\" every time he says something, he'll soon stop.

{"comment_text":"Edited for actual answer, not a ramble I think there's only two ways out of this, a confrontation around an event (or set of events), or working out with your friends for ways around this. It's not the hardest thing to ask \"Will be at the event? You can probably guess I'm not a huge fan of them.\" This also gives an opportunity to open up a discussion between you and the organizer about how you feel. It may turn out well, in that others share your opinions, but you've let your opinion be known regardless. You could also cut short your appearances when that person is around and leave (could include snark for extra dramatic effect - see ramble below). It would become obvious after a while that both of you don't tend to appear at the same time, but this could also start a rift. Ramble I'm reminded of certain public figures and relatives who try to crush your hand in a handshake - there's no point to this, except to show they're a real prick. This person seems like one of those people. Eddie Izzard on \"Hand Squeezy Death\" And some people do one of those squeezy handshakes, the small-dick crusher squeezy handshakes, the compensation handshake....they go into this and you don't react. You should react, because they get away with it, if someone starts crushing your hand, go \"ahhhh! fucking hell! You bastard! I hope you die in a car crash!\" Or do the complete opposite, and collapse on the floor - \"You killed him, man. He suffers from Hand Squeezy Death!\" My take on this is sarcasm, pure, undiluted sarcasm. The cynical side of me says point out your disgust: Usual comments are like \"wow you have really gotten fat\" \"Good point, what is it like then to be only able to buy shitty food? How good is nice food! All the chocolate all the time!\" \"you're useless and should go kill yourself\" \"OK, do you want to make the noose while I get the chair?

{"comment_text":"I've found a really useful term is \"comedic sociopathy\" - that is, there is a disconnect in comedy that makes the kind of joke that is actually horrible, seem funny when it is perceived as \"just\" a joke. This can include physical humor (slapstick, etc) but also includes other kinds of cruelty. I don't find these kinds of things funny, never have, not even in fiction where there is no genuine harm that can be done. I have on occasion explained this to others as my lacking such a disconnect, and so not enjoying things (usually movies) that they found funny but I found uncomfortable. In your case, though, using the actual term may help point out how you feel this person turning such \"humor\" on other people is inappropriate. This is especially bad because this person lacks the kind of judgement that can stop him shy of really hurting someone. If he can't tell some (or more) of his audience doesn't actually find this funny, or doesn't think that's reason enough to stop, then he almost certainly can't tell when he's crossed the line from humor into cruelty and equally wouldn't be able to tell when he is causing genuine harm. For someone to pull off this kind of humor, they really need excellent people skills and a whopping lot of tact. They have to know when someone is annoyed, uncomfortable, offended, or genuinely hurt, and how to gently disengage if they hit a real vulnerable point. Or else it needs to be, as previously mentioned, in fiction where the jokes and the people they are aimed at are not real and cannot be hurt - and even then care is needed to not catch others in the line of fire, if, say, mocking traits that do apply to real people.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"1489","post_title":"How do I deal with someone people think is funny, but I think is mean?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/1489","timestamp":"2017-08-08T13:49:21","char_len":1690,"word_len":302,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"From my own experience, my Father was very ill and died the day after my nephew's 21st birthday, what is important is to demonstrate care for the bereaved person, rather than to wish them a happiness which might seem inappropriate in the moment. To wish someone a happy day at the funeral of a close family member, as you clearly understand, has potential to be inappropriate, though the degree of inappropriateness would to some extent depend upon your existing relationship with Bob and the delivery of the wish. Something else which may be relevant is to think about what age Bob is. Is the birthday a significant one? Is he being 21, 30, 42? Any birthday which is in someway significant in your culture, or if Bob is still quite young, will seem like a bigger deal to be missing than a random birthday for a middle-aged person (I say this as a 53 year old, we're over the excitement of birthdays for the most part) The fact that you understand that and don't want to say the wrong thing shows that you do care for Bob, so it would be appropriate to find a form of words which recognises the fact of his birthday without wishing him present joy. This lets Bob know that he has not been forgotten but also understand the respect that you are showing to him and his Grandmother. The words you use will very much depend on your own personality and your relationship with Bob, but after you have generally expressed condolences, something along the lines of this would cover those points. ...and on top of how much we're all going to miss her, I wanted to say how sorry I was about the timing of everything and to let you know that I still remember that it's your day too. It is is a significant birthday that he's missing you could follow up with planning to meet up at some later stage (even if you wouldn't generally do that for his birthday you might want to this year as part of reinforcing family bonds and recognition of the horrible timing - but only if you actually would enjoy meeting up and it isn't wildly impractical due to travel times or something), or you could make a point of sending him a nice letter or a small gift in the following days. In the end only you can judge what would work in the relationship between you and Bob, but remember you can recognise his birthday without wishing it to be 'happy'.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"22342","post_title":"Etiquette when someone\u2019s birthday is on the same day as the funeral of one of their loved ones","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/22342","timestamp":"2019-07-09T16:08:13","char_len":2351,"word_len":428,"lang":"en"}

So Bob is supposed to grieve for his grandma and not take part in any festivities or unrespectful behavior for a while, even if he himself doesn't follow any religion. In the past, the period of mourning was either set by religious and cultural rules, or indicated by the affected person by wearing a black mourning attire. Since mourning people are supposed to withdraw from social events, it's in turn inappropriate to invite them to such events. Many people feel that those rules are historic now and don't follow them as strictly as a few decades ago, but the gist of \"you shouldn't celebrate when someone died\" still applies today.

{"comment_text":"This could come down to cultural differences. I too don't really have many friends and we just do a bar or dinner. Usually someone pays for the birthday person's meal while the rest pays for themselves. If we are at a bar, everyone usually buys the birthday person at least 1 shot\/drink. I have not been invited or invited people to something that requires an upfront fee like Topgolf since high school in which the birthday parents usually covered the costs. However, knowing how at least my area\/group of friends work it would be that individuals pay for themselves. If a friend cannot afford it, usually someone will help them out. It just depends on your friend dynamics. If you can afford it and are willing to pay for all then by all means do it if that's what you want! Another group of friends would usually just rotate who pays for the whole thing. One person would pay for the movies, the next time we all hang out another would buy a round of beer, the next time someone would buy tickets to a game. If it is expected that you pay but might not have the cash to, just post as part of the invitation that you will pay the $60 fee (you said no more than 2 hours at the assumed average price of $30) and that if anyone wants to help chip in to cover costs are more than welcome to. From my experience though, I have never gone to a birthday completely free.

{"comment_text":"The comments and discussion on your post pretty much show that these days we are all quick to diagnose someone moody as having either depression, bi-polar disorder, or say that they must be on the autism spectrum. In fact they might just be a moody person! I'm going to answer this question as posed, that is to say I am accepting your opinion that he does not have a condition causing this behaviour. There is almost certainly some trigger for his change in behaviour, perhaps stress from work or another aspect of his life. The way most people handle problems and stress is learned behaviour , and that can actually be harder to crack than if he did have a condition of some sort! It can be possible to develop a self-awareness of your condition that counters your default behaviour, but if you are reacting the way you think is normal then the only way that is going to change is if you first come to the realisation it may be unhealthy and then unlearn it, or learn a better way. You already state that he is a nice guy and you don't want to lose his friendship. This may mean accepting him the way he is! After all, we all want true friends and not \"fairweather\" friends who are only there in good times. But I agree that it would be good if you could talk to him about this, because a true friend should point out when you are wrong, and this could help him in his other friendships \/ relationships too. I don't feel there is any way to begin this when he already in one of his bad moods. To be successful you would need to convince him during an open and relaxed conversation that he sometimes displays unlikable traits, and then later, when he does behave that way remind him that he is doing it. Your barrier to this is that he doesn't like to talk about feelings at any time. Your best attempt would be to create an ideal setting to have the discussion. It should be on one of his \"good\" days, be relaxed and informal, and in the \"manliest\" setting possible, as you say that he finds talking about feelings \"umanly\"! I'm struggling to think of things that aren't clich\u00e9 here, but maybe over a beer? Also in my suggested responses I'm going to use the word \"friend\" but substitute this with whatever is the most \"manly\" term where you live, be it \"buddy\", \"pal\", \"mate\", or whatever. The aim here is to not sound like you are talking about feelings, even though you are. I would say: I want to talk to you about something. I know you won't want to hear this, but I'm trying to be a good friend. Sometimes you can be really difficult to deal with. I'm trying to figure out if I can help in any way? See what he says. If he doesn't understand what you mean, be more specific, but try not to attack his character. Just describe his behaviour; for example don't say he is moody, say he acts moody. Follow this up with: This isn't an attack on your character. You're a good friend and if you have a particular problem making you stressed, I want to help. Or, if he says there is no particular problem: Next time you behave that way, I'm just going to tell you. What should I say to you? He may not go along with this. But once you've planted this seed in his mind, follow up on it. When he behaves badly, say to him: You're doing it again. Snap out of it. I would suggest doing all of this with good humour. Lots of guys (particularly those that don't talk about feelings) are tough with their friends when they are joking around. If you keep your humour while you have this discussion, and also when you subsequently remind him about his behaviour it may just take the edge off it and show him that you are doing this as a friend.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"13315","post_title":"How to deal with moody friend?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/13315","timestamp":"2018-04-18T11:40:11","char_len":3703,"word_len":687,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I have the exact same issue, My hearing is actually good, I can hear a phone ringing over a loud television etc. and will often be telling my GF her phone is ringing when she can not here it. However, I am constantly saying 'What?!?' to my GF, and then before she repeats what she is saying it will click, and I can respond. My solution to this in my work environment is very simple. When some is talking to me I will completely stop whatever else I am doing, listen to what they say, and simply wait before I give a response. Its the classic, think before you speak. And by waiting i feel I give better clarity in responses. In my younger years I would be anxious about this, and sometimes just give a response without truly understanding what had just been said to me, and my responses were not always in tune with the conversation. Seriously the wait will not put people off, people value a though out response more than idle generic mumbo jumbo replies.

{"comment_text":"Background: I live in the northeast U.S., I assume I am about the same age range, and I am deaf, with cochlear implants. I often speak for myself, but struggle to understand what others say. I've been in many similar situations where I ask them to repeat what they say, repeatedly (This sometimes embarrasses me and annoys others). I believe I also have an audio processing delay, where exactly what you describe happens: \"I will often misunderstand words or have pauses when my language processing seems to \"lag\" (I might say \"sorry, I didn't catch that?\" and then right after the words are out of my mouth my brain catches up and I understand what they originally said).\" I also struggle with accents, because in addition to sounding differently, they move their lips differently than native English-speakers, so it causes difficulty with lipreading. That being said, I have encountered many, many situations where after asking them to repeat themselves at least twice, people either look at me weird or say \"never mind\", and look\/walk away. The people who really want to or need to socialize with me, regardless of my struggles will stick and have patience with me. Those are the two general kinds of interactions I've encountered - those who are patient and those who are not . For interacting with those who are not patient, I will try to be \"extra\" engaging with them, maintaining eye contact, laugh a little, say \"I'm sorry, I really, really want to talk with you, I am just having a hard time understanding you, because of... (background noise, accents, etc).\" Adding emphasis that you are not trying to be weird or avoid interaction, by asking them to repeat themselves may help them get that it is just your struggle, and you simply just need a tiny bit more patience to work out what you both want to say. For deaf people, (in my experience) what works best is having a different form of communication ready, if you need it. Most of the time, if they need to interact with you for work reasons, you can absolutely ask them if they don't mind using another form of communication. \"If you don't mind, I have a (pad+pencil\/pen, X communication app, etc) that will ensure that we can communicate a bit more smoother, can we use that instead?\" Maybe even before the conversation begins, ask: \"Can we exchange numbers so that if I don't understand you, you can easily text me what you wanted to tell me, so that communication flows better?\" They will be happy to have a easily accessible and consistent form of communication. Here are some ideas for written communication: Texting app (get the other person's number, and text back and forth) If the other person doesn't have a number, nothing wrong with a good old fashioned pen\/pencil and paper, or if you prefer digital communication, you can use your notes\/notepad app. There are some android and IOS apps for more visual communication, like Glide. That aside, my emphasis on how to ask them is be confident . Let them know that you communicate best with people you have a harder time understanding over digital or physical written communication, and once they understand that, there shouldn't be a problem, and you could even ask them if they don't mind writing down what they are saying, then you can speak for yourself? \"I may not catch what you say the first few times, so if that happens, can you write down what I am missing, and we can continue our conversation?\" Good communicators do take the effort to accommodate each other , so I don't consider it embarrassing to ask for just a little extra effort. It pays off in the end, and you both walk away happy and in clear understanding of each other! I hope this helps!

{"comment_text":"As I'm sure you know, cultural and family expectations are really hard to change. In your parents' case, it sounds like if they want to be open-minded then they'll take a ton of flack for it from the rest of their family and acquaintances. This shouldn't change what you decide to do (I wouldn't advise anyone to get married to appease someone else) but perhaps remembering this will help you deal with some of the push-back that they give you over this. Be Firm And Honest You need to help your parents understand everything you feel about this. They might think you are just rebelling or whining, and if you are completely set that this isn't the life you want for yourself, then you need to explain it. They will probably not understand, as it sounds like this is a long cultural tradition that they've expected you to accept for your entire life, but do everything you can to show them that this isn't some rebellious phase, a fit you're having, a Disney fantasy, or anything of the sort. Be clear that you've made a decision on how to live your life, and that you aren't willing to participate in an arranged marriage or some imposed timeline on when you should marry or have children. You should probably try to help them understand that you didn't just start thinking this, and that you've always objected to the idea of an arranged marriage. Offer Alternatives If you are not completely shut off to the ideas of marriage and a family (just that they have to happen on your own terms and timeline) then you should explain to your family that you are going to get married when you are ready and to a woman of your choosing. This may be easier for them to accept than the idea that you never marry and never have children (of course, if that's what you really want then skip this step). If you are open to it, consider promising them that they can be involved in setting up the marriage when you are serious about it. Show Love In Other Ways Your family is very likely to take your rejection of this tradition as a rejection of them; perhaps they will think you are in denial of who you are, you're ashamed of your family, etc etc ad nauseum. Try to show love for them in other ways. Make sure to call and care for them, and make sure they know that you still want to be their son and part of the family despite the fact that you reject having an arranged marriage. Whether or not they accept that is up to them, but make sure they know that for you, this isn't a rejection of them or your heritage, it's simply an unwillingness to have an arranged marriage. Don't feel ashamed This is kind of an aside, but a lot of people's families expect very specific things from their lives. For some families, the idea that you move to another state - under any conditions - is equivalent to telling your family you wish they were dead. Lots of parents have unrealistic demands for their children, and just because yours isn't a common one for the country you live in doesn't mean you should be ashamed of it.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"14139","post_title":"How can I be more assertive when telling my family that I don&#39;t want to marry?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/14139","timestamp":"2018-05-07T14:16:38","char_len":3020,"word_len":556,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I have some acquaintances from India who have similar views to yours about bringing children into the world. For them it's an ethical stance about doing their small part in avoiding overpopulation. (I'm simplifying their ideas greatly, of course.) It's a courageous personal stance worthy of respect. It's also a radical stance that flies in the face of all (more-or-less) human customs throughout most of our history as a species. And, as you know, you are not just challenging your family with this, but also challenging the customs of your country and the world. It seems unlikely that you will be able to convince your parents or other family members that you are right. Even if you challenge your parents on a trivial matter they are unlikely to say immediately, \"oh dear son, you are right about that and I am wrong.\" It may take a few hours or days for them to come around to your point of view. And that's about trivial things. On such a vast question as marriage and children, it may take your family centuries (literally) to accept your point of view. In the meantime your parents will be puzzled and hurt, and wishing it were not so. You ask about being assertive. You will have to say something like, \"I have made up my mind about this. I am aware of your reasons for changing my mind, and with great respect, I do not accept them. I am willing to have an honest conversation with you about the reasons for my choice. But I am not willing to negotiate my choice with you.\" You will probably have to repeat those words dozens of times to the same people. Keep in mind that your parents' dreams for you will not be fulfilled. They will require a period of mourning for the loss of those dreams, before they can move on. You can't expect them to agree with you, or even admit that your position has merit. And you can't expect them to stop using guilt to manipulate you. Edit You asked, \"how can I be assertive?\" Please consider this: being assertive is not being \"aggressive.\" Being assertive means speaking truly with personal conviction. It's hard to be assertive with family, because they will try to draw you into negotiation. They will try to draw you into a word game where there are winners and losers: where being aggressive helps. If they do get you to join the game they will work hard to win. And, for you to win the game you're forced to make them lose. That's hard with family. It's much easier, and more respectful, to avoid the negotiation game by refusing to play it. Your choice is one of great courage. The future life of the world depends on choices like yours. I wish you continued courage and steadfastness.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"14139","post_title":"How can I be more assertive when telling my family that I don&#39;t want to marry?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/14139","timestamp":"2018-05-07T14:16:38","char_len":2665,"word_len":477,"lang":"en"}

Your parents come from the world of arranged marriages, accepting one's Karma, and place, and submitting to the pressures all around. In this world view you will be punished if you rebel. You could bring the view of these two cultures to your parents, and show them why you are taking the path you are.

They know that if they phrase it as if they are asking a favour of you (e.g. by saying \"Can I ask you a question?\" or \"Do you have a minute?\") and you just say \"No\", you will feel rude or uncomfortable, therefore you'll be reluctant to do that. So If you just say \"No thanks\", no matter what they said, they'll get the message, and you'll get to keep your feeling of politeness.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"3223","post_title":"Appropriate ways to dismiss street vendors?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/3223","timestamp":"2017-09-03T13:49:45","char_len":1026,"word_len":201,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"(Former outbound telephone market researcher - NOT telesales! - here). Agreeing with several about 'fast \"no, thanks\"'. Adding \"and leave\/be consistent if they follow\". Telephone equivalent: \"and hang up\". The reason any response, including this one, feels rude is that it is rude - and the setup and query are carefully designed by the company to be that way. Anything that isn't \"help your neighbour\" will feel rude, so it's more likely that you'll listen\/go along with them, at least a little bit. Yes, it's not the querier's fault that they're setting you up to be rude to them, it's the faceless policy creator in the office; even that is part of the design to get you to not do the rude thing to the person who is just doing their job. If you're still talking, you're still willing to be convinced. We were told that on day 1 of training; and it proved true many times (sure, less than 1%; but much more than 0%). In a world where success in an easy survey is measured in 3-5 hits per hour, it's worth a few minutes on that 1-in-200 chance. The other thing we were told on day 1 is that it's a numbers game; the more people you ask, the more likely you'll get a response. Take the (many, many!) \"No\"s in stride and go on to the next potential \"Yes\". So, if you truly aren't interested, the politest thing you can do is \"No thanks\" and walk away. If they push, \"no thanks\" and walk away. As politely as you can. From message 2, it's the best response (even over \"yes, I'll listen for a bit 'to be nice', but the answer's no\" - as long as it really is a hard \"no\") for the querient - and, if they are a veteran (> 1 month on the job!), they'll be immune to the \"rude\", so you're not really \"being rude\". Message 1 means that if you try to \"be polite\", you might get sucked up in it (which you don't want), or you waste 2 or 3 approaches of their time (which might have hit).","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"3223","post_title":"Appropriate ways to dismiss street vendors?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/3223","timestamp":"2017-09-03T13:49:45","char_len":1901,"word_len":359,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Explain what you're working on that day. This has multiple advantages and is a tactic not only relevant to programming: Talk about what your current issues are, or a nice little pattern and what it solves. You can explain the type of thing you're making, what the challenge is in that part and possible solutions. Also telling the solution the yesterdays problem is useful here. As your problems\/solutions change (due to you being ready for the next challenge), it gives a feel for what you're doing. You couldn't progress if all you do is game. This takes a bit of time, but can build trust. Explaning what you're doing is quite a valuable skill in programming. for some, its absolute magic what we do and knowing how to explain to non-peers makes it less magic, which in turn helps a lot politically. It offers insights to peers, who might help you identify your error in thinking, or may offer a solution you didnt think of. Rubber ducking is very valuable \" if you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough \". By explaining what you're doing, you can get a feel for which parts are not second nature for yourself. If you stuggle to explain something, it might be a hint on what you can improve. It allows them to talk about your hobby. They'll likely not understand, but its a small outlet for you and they might get a basic feel of what you're doing. By explaining things often, they might connect at least some dots. And a bit pessimistic: Programming is boring for a lot of people. It could also be they feel bored quickly and leave the subject alone. Not a very enthousiasic response, but one that in the end will also solve your corrent challenge. Apart from the above (which you can\/should do anyway), you can ask them what the issue is. I'm dutch, so I'm used to being a bit more direct, but IMO that is a effective method in this cases as miscommunication created the situation, so clear communication is the way out. I feel there is an issue with my computer usage, mainly because there seems to be the assumption I use it to game all the time. Yes I like to game a bit, but not all the time.

{"comment_text":"Facts are better than words. Since they do not believe you are leaning to code, you must show them a real result. Also you need to build trust. And finally you need to keep learning to code. All those things can be achievable if you ask them which software you can do for them. \"I think now I know enough to try to make a small piece of software, any ideas?\" This approach will be useful. Because if they don't trust you, they will ask for something specific enough to test you, and once you deliver they will believe you (each small deliver done based in their requests will build trust). Also is useful because you'll learn how to prepare a list of requirements, ask for feedback and show advance (you must show any advance you have). All those soft skills are quite useful for people whose work is to write code. Actually, whenever my boss ask for something which is not precisely defined, I must show small advances to help him define what he really wants. If they don't cooperate.

{"comment_text":"You say that you want to tell her because you think it will help you move on. There are two major errors in this thought: Moving on is a gift you give yourself, it is not something that someone else has to (or, often, even can ) do for you. If you truly want to move on, you need to get out there, meet more people (both men and women), maybe find a new hobby, and build up a good life for yourself without her. Maybe you'll get interested in another woman instead, maybe you won't, but the point is to enjoy your life enough on your own that you no longer feel a need to make her a part of it. Even if you do tell her, it won't help. When I was a teenager, my first love was a girl who was dating one of my friends. She and I were also very close friends, and I told her how I felt about her. She (and everyone else) knew I was totally crazy about her, but we were still able to maintain our friendship. None of this made it any easier for me to deal with or get over my feelings for her - if anything, it made it even more painful to be in that situation, and made it harder for me to move on. Also, in my experience, women tend to be pretty good at picking up on this sort of thing, so there's a good chance she already knows (or at least suspects) how you feel. The kindest thing you can do - for both of you - is to allow her to remain unaware of your feelings (or at least to continue pretending to be unaware) and move on romantically without trying to force the issue with her.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"25631","post_title":"How can I tell a coworker about my feelings for her without damaging our working relationship?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/25631","timestamp":"2020-05-20T01:22:33","char_len":1508,"word_len":304,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I'm not sure this is possible. Knowing someone has romantic feelings for you changes the dynamic, and things are almost certainly going to be awkward for at least a while. If you truly don't expect anything from her and want your relationship to stay the same, you're probably best off keeping your mouth shut. However, if you want her to squash that tiny iota of hope you're harboring and relieve yourself of a secret, it may be possible to do that. There's no guarantee your confession won't ruin things, but there are a few things you can do to minimize the risk. Personally, if a friend told me they had a crush on me but weren't expecting me to do anything about the knowledge, they simply wanted to tell me, I wouldn't believe them. People confess romantic feelings because they want a romantic relationship. If you don't want anything to change, then why bring it up? Ask yourself if you're truly okay with her turning you down completely and unequivocally. Be honest. If you can't, then this is probably a terrible idea. She's already going to doubt you'll be fine with it, and that's what makes it awkward. To get around this, you'll have to provide a convincing and sincere reason for telling her other than seeking a relationship. Luckily, you've got a fairly convincing reason in your question: you know it's absurd, but there's a tiny voice telling you that if you never say anything, you'll never know for sure she's not interested. You want to say something so she can tell you straight out that she's completely uninterested and you have zero chance. Say that. If she tries to soften the blow when she says no or seems uncertain how to respond, reiterate that you truly need a devastating rejection so you can put the idea to rest for good and move on. She's going to be hesitant about turning you down because she won't want to hurt you, so let her know you won't be hurt and you fully expect rejection. Be upbeat and sincere, and maybe she will believe it and be honest. Although I've not been in this exact situation, I do often ask people if they want to do things that I want them to feel zero pressure to agree to. I've had good results with cheerfully telling them \"you can say no, I promise, it's totally fine.\" It often gets people to admit they aren't really interested. Especially if there's a reason I expect they'll probably say no (short notice, likely to already have plans, etc), then I'll even preface the request with something like \"I know you'll probably be unable to, but I figured it doesn't hurt to ask just in case you happen to be interested and available...\" It only works when it's sincere though, which is why I say not to try this unless you really mean it. After she confirms that no, she is not interested, thank her with a positive attitude. At this point I'd probably acknowledge she's probably feeling awkward and uncertain about how things will be between the two of you. Personally I'd make a joke like \"so... How long should we be awkward around each other?\" Don't pretend like your confession should have no effect on her whatsoever, that's not fair. Hopefully she'll laugh it off and say things will be fine, but it's possible she'll want some space. That's her right, and it's the risk you're taking by telling her you have romantic feelings for her. Even if she wants to stay friends, she may feel like she's betraying her boyfriend by being close friends with someone who likes her. It's possible he's a jealous person and has already expressed concerns about you. Maybe a part of her is attracted to you, and that will make her decide it's too risky to her relationship to be close to you. There are lots of reasons outside of your control that could cause this to end badly for you even if you do everything right.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"25631","post_title":"How can I tell a coworker about my feelings for her without damaging our working relationship?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/25631","timestamp":"2020-05-20T01:22:33","char_len":3796,"word_len":679,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Imagine your reaction if your feelings aren't mutual When I was in high school I had my first partner. A few months after that my best friend started acting a bit strange towards me, they seemed to always be down around me and wouldn't talk to me as much as before. After me asking repeatedly why they were feeling down and telling them they could confide in me, they told me they loved me and that they kept the secret because I was in a relationship and so it seemed that their love couldn't be reciprocated because I was with someone else. I indeed didn't love them back and we remained friends, but they were very distant for a few months after that: they told me afterwards that they had to take some time to accept the situation so we could go back to being friends. Which is why I invite you to think about it - if she tells you she doesn't feel the same way about you, even if the confession doesn't make her feel awkward, how do you think you will feel? Will you be able to go back to how things were before? Confessing feelings can make people uncomfortable Today's society isn't very inviting to demonstrations of affection. We're not used to tell people we like them or that we think they're great - we'd rather show than tell. So when someone tells a person they love them - which is supposed to be the biggest form of affection towards someone - it can make things very awkward for the latter if they don't share these feelings. So even if you don't think you'd be uncomfortable with her not reciprocating your feelings, maybe she will be uncomfortable for not liking you the same way you do. It might put a strain (even a temporary one) on your relationship. I believe that things could go back to normal after some time, because that's what happened to my best friend and I, but I think this happen when you've had a strong bond before and that you both care enough about the relationship to preserve it after this happened. Be honest about why you think you had to tell her Given the risks I mentioned above, I wouldn't confess to her. You have a great relationship, but work is involved and that makes things more complicated. You don't know if you might have to work with her in the future. Your coworkers may be made aware of your feelings and even if she trusts you and cares for you, maybe some of your colleagues could see it in a different light and use it against you (the worst thing I could think of is them accusing you of harassment at the workplace). But I understand you want to be honest with her so what I'd advise you to do is to make it clear why you're telling her: Hey Anna, there's something I need to tell you. There's no easy way to say this but I think I have feelings for you. I'm not expecting you to feel the same way, and I'm telling you because I value honesty and thought it might help me moving forward. I really hope this won't change our relationship because I care about you as a friend. With such a phrasing you tell her why you had to confess and what you're expecting from the confession. It also lets her space to tell you how she feels about you. This does not guarantee things not to be awkward between you (even for some time) afterwards but I think it's the best way to convey your feelings without embarrassing her if they're not mutual.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"25631","post_title":"How can I tell a coworker about my feelings for her without damaging our working relationship?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/25631","timestamp":"2020-05-20T01:22:33","char_len":3318,"word_len":621,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"If your goal is to get your feelings for your teammate off your chest and move on, your plan is fine. As well, if you've seen signs that she is reciprocating your feelings for her, your plan is fine. If you're hoping to build a relationship with her, I would suggest against this. In fact, since you have BPD I would suggest against it in the first two cases as well. People with BPD tend to have trouble not rushing in head-long into new relationships, and idolizing their partner. It would be beneficial to pump the breaks somewhat and get to know her one on one more. Likewise, people who are inexperienced with relationships have a tendency for grand and showy gestures, or confessions. When this is done you do not enter into a prospective relationship as equals. You enter into the relationship strongly invested whereas the other party is not. This creates a situation where the person you wish to be with is under significant pressure to match the intensity of your feelings, and to decide right away to do so. Similarly, giving a gift or performing some other grand gesture along with your confession taints the gesture, putting more pressure onto the party who is receiving this gift or service to reciprocate, proportional to the value of the gift or service. And some gifts just aren't appropriate for someone you do not have a close relationship with already. In your case in particular, giving the gift sounds fine, so long as you do not make it a time when you confess your feelings. Her birthday is about her, and the gift is for her, so it is not an appropriate time to make it about your feelings and sate your need to get them off your chest. I would instead suggest you make arrangements to see her more often if you are able. Go on dates with her, essentially. You can call these dates or not as you like, and depending on how they go, then that would be the best time to express how you are feeling about her. As you build up attraction between the two of you, she will then have a higher likelihood of reciprocating your feelings. You could make these arrangements now, over text or at church. Or you could make them at her birthday if you're unable to see her in person until then. But I would say that earlier is your best bet. As for what to say, you know your friend best. Invite her to something you both will enjoy, that isn't too high commitment or formality, and will give you an opportunity to talk to each other (movie dates aren't a great idea generally). Some better examples are getting ice cream, going to a cafe, or going to an arcade. Ideally think of something to do after the fact if you both are enjoying your time together, and want to extend it past the original outing.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28737","post_title":"How should I confess my feelings to a teammate I&#39;m falling for?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28737","timestamp":"2024-06-12T15:53:37","char_len":2722,"word_len":497,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I would try to firmly establish boundaries that you both can live with. This would involve compromising on both your side and hers. Judging from your comment, you can go without smoking for quite some time and even do so for weekends and vacations. That might be a good place to start! You'll have to open with the decision to keep smoking. Maybe even an apology for hiding the habit (although you don't have to go into the full detail). But if you then transition into a cooperative discussion over how you can set boundaries, you can show that you are in fact compromising. After opening on your decision to not stop, bring up how you would like to establish when and how you can smoke without interfering with her. Yes, you didn't give in to the ask to stop, but by asking for input and offering ideas, you are demonstrating the ability to compromise and a wish to work with her rather than against her. I'll admit I am a complete non-smoker and have quite a few problems with it since even second-hand smoke is quite harsh for me. I've had breathing problems. Anyways, I had a roommate for 4 years that was an avid smoker (pack a day at one point) and we were able to make it work. This was done through boundaries. My roommate would only smoke outside for instance. Now you don't have to hold to that strict a standard, but I would recommend you pick a particular place or two around your home that you smoke and no more. You said its part of your routine, but I'm not sure where\/when this applies. If you only smoke at work, this is a lot easier, but I'm guessing you're trying to smoke at home to. Non-smokers (depending on sensitvitiy) can smell smoke for quite some time, and it usually embeds itself in furniture over time. If you pick a 'designated' area then yes, the problem is still there, but it can be either in a location she doesn't use often (a personal den of yours) or in an area that has good airflow and she doesn't have to remain in 'contact' with the air for long. Best way to sound uncompromising? Actually compromise and work out the best solution both can live with. That does mean neither side gets everything they want (She didn't get you to stop smoking and you'll have to match your routine to these boundaries) but it sounds like you both care about each other.

{"comment_text":"Firstly you have to ask yourself what's more important to you: your girlfriend's wishes, or your desire to smoke? If you care more about your girlfriend than smoking, then you need to focus on how best to quit. You will probably find that your girlfriend will be very supportive in your efforts. If, on the other hand, you simply do not want to quit smoking - regardless of your girlfriend's wishes - then this is entirely your choice. But you need to be honest with her about it. You need to tell her directly that you simply don't want to quit. This then becomes a question for her : does she love you enough to accept it and live with it? Of course, you can approach this as gently as you like, and with as much sensitivity in the way you choose your words and the way you speak. But ultimately if your decision is that you don't want to stop smoking, you can not avoid telling her that. If her answer is no, then there will be some heartache, but at least you will both have your answer . What you must not do is lie, by pretending that you quit (or are trying to quit), while actually having no intention to do so. That is utterly unfair on her, because if she doesn't see a long-term future with a partner who smokes, you're effectively stringing her along, allowing her to believe that you have a future when actually you don't. Ultimately it's your decision: nobody can force you to quit smoking. You may do as you please, with your own life. But you need to be honest, and acknowledge that your decisions affect others. From my own experience : I detest everything about smoking. When I met my first girlfriend (over the internet!) I began to feel for her before I discovered that she smoked. I was upfront with her, telling her that I hated smoking. However she avoided the issue , giving the impression that she would eventually quit when the time was right. Over 3 years later, she was still smoking - and I only then realised that she didn't actually want to quit, and she never intended to. If I had known her position at the beginning, then at least I would have been clear that she was not right for me. It was only the hope that she intended to quit, that made me put up with it at the beginning. However, smoking has no place in my future. I was not upset because she chooses to keep smoking. I was upset that she effectively lied to me, meaning that I wasted 3 years of my life with her. (Smoking was not the only reason we broke up - but it's one of the indicative factors showing that she never really cared about my feelings.) You need to be honest with your partner.

However, if the reaction of the moderator is a fair reflection of the netiquette in that group, then it could very well have been. Your feedback In general, however, this doesn't seem to be out of line. It doesn't sound like you were simply bashing the OP, or even trying to be hurtful. Furthermore, they specifically asked for feedback , pointing to a few areas where they might be able to improve. As your private messages show, no offense was taken. If feedback is only allowed to be nice and sugarcoated, the feedback is pointless. If that is the only acceptable response, the OP isn't looking for feedback, they simply want to show off their work and be able to ignore all wrongs with it. How to handle the PM from the moderator You could explain your point that they specifically asked for feedback and that in a PM you had an amicable exchange, so no offense was given: I'm sorry that you feel this feedback was offensive. The asker specifically asked for feedback, and they even responded thankfully. That's pretty much all you can do. Explain yourself and that is that. It serves little purpose to sugarcoat things, making your point more unclear. On the other hand, this shouldn't really be a reason for the moderator to start banning you. Don't expect their opinion to change though, not for this post, or for future posts. That way, you can't be disappointed. It's also not worth getting into an argument over this with the moderator, you are unlikely to convince them of your right, while you are likely to rub hairs the wrong way and possibly get yourself kicked. If your intention of joining the group is to have a place to improve your crafts and give honest feedback, this might just not be the group for you. There are plenty of these groups out there, so there really is no reason to stick around in a place you don't like. The diversity of groups on Facebook also brings with it a diversity of etiquette. Find yourself one that matches your intentions. On why it is not worth arguing While this is something you might be emotionally invested in, all it takes for the moderator to deal with your arguments is a single press on the delete\/ban button. I have seen this happen from both sides, not only on Facebook, but also in game chats and on other websites; people disagreeing with how a group is moderated and going on a crusade to convince everybody of their right. And it doesn't matter if you are right or not, 9 out of 10 times, the moderator grows tired of you and throws you out. Being emotionally invested doesn't help you beating a brick wall, it only hurts more. And that is even assuming that the problem lies just with the moderator. If the entire moderation team, or even the entire community feels the same way, you are going to have an even hard time convincing them.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"6817","post_title":"Does it go against netiquette to give constructive feedback on Facebook?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/6817","timestamp":"2017-11-16T07:57:52","char_len":3306,"word_len":582,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Does it go against netiquette to provide constructive feedback in a Facebook group? That depends on the definition of \"netiquette\". My personal brew of common sense would say \"constructive criticism is even essential to a community that exists for the purpose of mutually giving tips and tricks and ways to improve\". That being said - My personal brew may not necessarily be shared by everyone on the internet. And quite obviously not by the admin of the group you encountered. Or sharing ways for improvement just isn't the purpose of that group. If not, how do I explain so to the moderator and ask them to put something in their rules so other people won't make the same mistake, without a risk of getting kicked from the group? This ... We shouldn't have to put such things in a group rule. It's common sense and good manners! is a good indicator that you don't ( in this case ). What this says (when I read between the lines) is: \" You don't have good manners and you don't have common sense. My worldview is the right one and if you dare to have a different opinion you are a rude person and deserve my wrath (and censorship).\" I don't think it is worth your time and effort to argue with a person that has delusional views regarding etiquette and not the least common sense as well as (quite obviously, being that rude herself) good manners. Maybe the local perception of having power over others is a little too much for her to handle decently. If you find the group good for getting inspiration, consider just participating passively or exchanging actually useful criticism outside the group (e.g. via PM if possible). I also second Jarko's suggestion: Find yourself one that matches your intentions. Addendum: ...so other people won't make the same mistake, without a risk of getting kicked from the group? This is very nice of you. But it is even harder to achieve. The Mod\/Admin explicitly stated their stance on that matter and that adding an explicit rule won't happen. So all you could do is go to the group, read all comments, answers etc and \"heads up\" the authors of possible \"problematic\" posts.

{"comment_text":"This was well received by the maker, we continued our chat via private messenger and I gave her more advice (...) She also showed me some tricks (...) So your feedback seems to have been well received and led to an interesting discussion in which you and her learned something new. Perhaps you even made a friend. Very good. Now, there are several kinds of communities like this: The community you (and her) thought you were in, where people ask for feedback in order to improve. Said feedback will sometimes be negative (the sandwich method works wonders). In fact, suggestions for improvement are the most useful kind of feedback. The level of negativity will of course depend on the community. For example I frequent a French electronics forum where the occasional clueless newbie comes in asking about how to build a high power railgun or how to play with lithium polymer batteries. Since this will most likely result in electrocution or fire, the answers aren't usually very \"nice\"... On the opposite side of the spectrum, I know a few people who are fanfiction authors, and when they get any kind of feedback sandwich, they're usually very flattered that someone was interested enough in their work to take the time to think about ways to improve it. In fact they often even beg for feedback. The other kind of community is the \"participation trophy\" one. In this case, people only come in to get a pat on the back and an ego boost, not to improve in their craft. I suspect you wouldn't be interested in this kind of community... The pet community which exists only as a means for the owner to socialize, exert authority, boost their ego, etc. I removed your post. We want people to be nice. That means you can't criticize other peoples crafts. Well, your mistake was simply that you both thought you were in the first kind of community, whereas the moderator thought you were either in the second or third, or both at the same time. In my opinion, being \"nice\" means helping others, even if it means some tough love. In her opinion, being \"nice\" means keeping everything proper and tidy with a complete absence of any conflict whatsoever. Please picture a Dolores Umbridge type character meticulously ironing out the kinks in her tablecloth. The reply that came to this message is still puzzling me today (...) \"We shouldn't have to put such things in a group rule. It's common sense and good manners!\" So, \"We shouldn't have to put such things in a group rule. It's common sense and good manners!\" -- this fits the character. Additionally, nebulous or imprecise rules allow a more liberal interpretation, which increases the moderator's power. You can't appeal to a vague rule. Also consider her stern tone and unwillingness to discuss matters with you. She sounds like she's correcting a misbehaving child. I understand your annoyance... Does it go against netiquette to provide constructive feedback in a Facebook group? Nope. If not, how do I explain so to the moderator and ask them to put something up in their rules so other people won't make the same mistake, without a risk of getting kicked from the group? If my characterization is accurate, you won't be able to. But you can always emphasize that helping people improve can't be done without pointing out what needs improvement, which means that constructive criticism is unavoidable.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"6817","post_title":"Does it go against netiquette to give constructive feedback on Facebook?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/6817","timestamp":"2017-11-16T07:57:52","char_len":3413,"word_len":576,"lang":"en"}

I then gave some advice on how to pick colors, and on what to keep in mind when picking different kinds of yarn. I ended with a compliment to the creativeness of the craft. This is exactly what I would have done, so I am surprised that the mod jumped on you. It is certainly not obvious that there should be no criticism, even gentle suggestions, on a craft forum.

That shade of orange makes me want to vomit! Next time choose a brighter colour using . as opposed to... If you decide to make another one, a brighter shade of orange would be lovely.

{"comment_text":"Background Simiarly, I belong to a group for building brands, where the ages can be as low as 14. Being a designer myself (as a career), I've learned to take criticism and feedback as comments on my piece, not necessarily comments on my person. All of this took time, experience and confidence building, had over the years of college and on-the-job situations. Taking feedback\/critique\/criticism is a learned skill, and what could be you simply saying something looks off, could make the receiving person feel 'personally attacked.' Which causes a lash-out in most cases. Given this information, you can't get better if people don't point out flaws to help you, I generally avoid groups with a \"be nice\" rule because of this. I'd rather be told something sucks, with feedback, than get ego-tripped because I keep getting comments telling me something is good. Answer I don't think you're in the wrong here, I think people should be open to their faults and more receptive to feedback, especially if it's valid and based on facts\/further information (ie: color theory or color mixing). I feel any group that oppresses these kinds of comments is not allowing their members to grow as artists\/creatives. That being said, this does have a slight caveat. Caveat Just like most situations, judge your surroundings, is this group for people who want to eventually make a living off their craft? Are they trying to be the best, or is it just a hobby? These groups will react differently depending on what they want, in example: Group 1: People serious about their craft Person 1: \"You won't sell this design because of X, you should try Y\" This is usually received by a \"thanks for the feedback + either a defense of their design, or inquiring for more info\/showing an updated version Where as group 2, where it is just people doing it for hobby, the same comment could return a drastically different response. This is because, since they don't think of their craft as a 'business' you are not not attacking a 'creative entity(Think of a business)'. Now it comes across as you attacking someone's person\/personal decisions they chose for their art. TL:DR; It's alright to give feedback, in fact it's better to be critical as it helps someone grow as an artist. However, you should be aware of the type of people in the group and what their goals are, as this will usually affect how they receive said feedback.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"6817","post_title":"Does it go against netiquette to give constructive feedback on Facebook?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/6817","timestamp":"2017-11-16T07:57:52","char_len":2434,"word_len":412,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"As you describe it, his standards deviate from the norm. His notion that all criticism is destructive criticism is plain wrong. It's his forum, his press and his freedom of press, and he has a right to set any standard he pleases. But where he deviates from normal expectations, he needs to be clear about that. The fairest way to resolve it is to daylight it, and let a conversation follow. Post a message on the forum asking what people think about constructive criticism -- ask them if they think that only unqualified kudos, thumbs up and awesome's should be acceptable here, or if people should be able to honestly ask for constructive criticism and receive it. Keep the viewpoint totally positive, nothing to criticize. Make best effort to time it for when the admin has left , and won't be back for awhile. That way the conversation is fully engaged before he joins, otherwise he'll just delete it on the spot. The result of this conversation is that the mod will find his own constituency disagrees with him. This will fundamentally alter the group in one of several ways. mod changes values to match the crowd. you learn the unwritten rule has a reason you didn't know about, and maybe mod revises written rules. mod learns nothing, stands to viewpoint, but does so civilly, and now you know this is the \"approval-seeking suckup\" group. Good to know. mod throws some sort of tantrum, e.g. deleting discussion, everyone knows he did that, and the reasonable people clear out. mod possibly \/kicks you, but that conforms with what you would want anyway.

I have seen this happen again and again, including on several forums that I run. Both from what you describe and from the reaction of the original poster, it seems clear that you behaved properly.

You will clash again. Once these jerks identify a victim, they pile it on.

{"comment_text":"Like anything else, you're always free to say: No. Particularly when it comes to sex, or particular sex acts you aren't comfortable with, \"no\" is always an option. In the case of oral sex there are lots of perfectly reasonable reasons to say no. Some people find it morally objectionable, some find it objectifying, some don't like the effort involved, some simply don't like it, and the list goes on. The most common reason I've heard is that it's not reciprocal... If this is your objection address it specifically, some people just aren't as aware as they ought to be when it comes to these things. A quick conversation may clear that issue up. Whatever your reasons are, your partner should understand them and respect them. But that means you're going to have to have an open honest conversation about it. Usually the easiest way to address these things with a long term partner is to sugar coat it a little bit. I really don't like doing X, could we do Y instead? Alternatives soften the blow a little, you're not rejecting your partner, or their needs, you're rejecting the specific act. Sometimes the alternative came become a preference, and ideally it will be something that you both enjoy. I'm guessing that you're both somewhat inexperienced, being newly married and all. Sometimes offering to explore and find something new that you both like will send your partner's mind racing away from the things you don't like, and lay the ground work towards a better sex life in general. I really don't like X, could we explore and find something new to try? Variety is the spice of life, don't get trapped in a routine that doesn't work for you.

Be sure to do this in such a way that its not him that you don't like, but that particular act (or acts if there are others). Your delivery of this news to him will be key in that it should in no way be an attack on him . Also, be prepared for your husband to be a bit shocked, a little pissed, and surprised by the fact that you all of the sudden ( from his perspective ) are not interesting in performing this act.

{"comment_text":"I've been wrapping my mind around this question for some time now. What makes it so complex for me is that you, Chammpi have given so little context. How do I tell him that I don't like oral sex anymore without hurting his feelings... and I fear that he will go for other women if I reject oral sex IMO, it all boils down to two questions: (1) how realistic is this expectation (that he will seek a new oral-sex-provider) ? and closely related... (2) if he did - what effects would that have on you? (1) As long as your husband doesn't know that you dislike giving oral sex to him, he has no cue to change or seek resolution together with you. In my personal definition, a \"good husband\" would be at least concerned if he knew that his wife does something she strongly dislikes; he would then try to find a good solution for both of them, plus he would encourage more openness in all aspects to forming the relationship in a way it fits to the needs of both partners. I am well aware though that there are different definitions of a \"good husband\", specially in contexts with high social pressure being put on young people to succeed as wife \/ husband, and the absence of options to design the relationship or get divorced. This is especially true if someone else chose that person for you and arranged that marriage with you having little or no say in this. (2) As others have noted, if oral sex is an essential part of your relationship, and your husband is likely to ignore your needs, and you are really dependent on this marriage, then there is a different perspective. In this case, I would like to motivate you to reduce your dependency on this marriage. I frankly do not know if and to what extent this is possible for you, I certainly wish it is. If you would choose that path, \"optimizing\" the act itself (making it less troubling for you) might be the way to go, until you are in the position to stop doing it. In strategic marital counselling there are strategies applied to influence the partner's behaviour by changing own behaviour, if the partner does not come to the counselling sessions, talking about it is not an option (yet), and the issue is putting damage on one partner. These strategies do not involve talking about it, but altering the underlying structure of the interaction in ways that make it less desirable - see example . The information given in the question is too vague though to suggest a specific strategy.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"8437","post_title":"How do I communicate to my husband that I don&#39;t like oral sex?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/8437","timestamp":"2017-12-26T05:45:40","char_len":2495,"word_len":445,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I would say that it's better to focus on trying to understand why your husband likes that instead of trying to express what you want. Usually, when we feel that our proposal may be rejected, we will have an insecurity, and this insecurity will make others insecure as well, and both sides will be dragged into a vicious cycle with no way out. The ability to help each of you discover a new facet of your partner is that both persons work out to find the exact reasons why he likes this and you don't. Why do you feel oral sex disgusting, and why does he like it? What memories bring you two to your current situation? When you have answers for this, you and your husband will be surprised for yourself and each other, and your memories will be appreciated by the other. By getting to the mindset of exploring the other's perspective instead of telling it is bad without reasons, both of you can see the benefits to construct the conversation, instead of having insecurities and having to sugarcoat it. The I-message will be used reflexively, and you will listen mindfully and be curious for a perspective you don't know of, instead of feeling frustrated or attacked.

So I'm glad you're being mindful of not putting them in an awkward position! I do not recommend hinting around, like asking \"do you need to blow your nose?\" -- this comes across as very condescending, as if I'm a child who needs to be reminded how to take care of my own body. Instead, if they're sniffling, let them know you have tissues if they'd like one: \"do you need a tissue? I've got some in my bag\". This is a polite offer (maybe I don't have any with me but didn't want to ask) and leaves the choice up to me (not pushy). If they decline, you could hint a little: holding out a tissue, asking \"you sure you don't want one?\" when they start sniffling again. But, be aware that mentioning it repeatedly starts to feel like the first option (and honestly sometimes, like with a cold - I'd rather sniffle a bit than go through a million tissues and sandpaper the skin off my nose). So you'll need to weigh the irritation of listening to their sniffles (and\/or if you think they're embarrassing themself in front of others) vs. how much you think they'd be irritated by your request. However, if it's more of a visible problem, you can treat it in the same way you would tell them they had something in their teeth - a quick \"hey, you might wanna blow your nose\", with a discreet gesture to indicate usually gets the message across. This is pretty universally embarrassing, so regardless of feelings about sniffles I've always appreciated being made aware of this.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"422","post_title":"How can I politely ask someone to blow their nose in public?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/422","timestamp":"2017-07-02T08:48:29","char_len":1645,"word_len":295,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I can only speak for myself, but I would consider asking \"do you need a tissue?\" to be just as condescending as \"do you need to blow your nose?\". If you really want, what you can do is blow your own nose to indicate you have plenty of tissues at your disposal. But the onus is really on the snotty person to deal with their snot. If they aren't dealing with it, there's a good chance it's because they don't care about how it impacts others, or aren't aware of the impact. That leaves you with the choice of making them aware of the impact on you, or to try to be more accepting of the sound and sight of their snot.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"422","post_title":"How can I politely ask someone to blow their nose in public?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/422","timestamp":"2017-07-02T08:48:29","char_len":622,"word_len":122,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"When resolving a minor domestic dispute, it's helpful to keep two things in mind: Use \"I statements\". There is a lot of information about this on the internet, but basically it means talk about how YOU feel rather than about how your roommate's behaviour is wrong. For example, you might say something like \"Hey, I know you need to take work calls during the day, but I find the noise quite distracting.\" Rather than something like \"Your phone calls are annoying and loud.\" Make sure you keep in mind that this is a compatibility question, not a question of \"right and wrong\" or \"reasonable and unreasonable\". As roommates, your job is to find a way to live that is suitable to both of you. For example, saying something like \"I have a favour to ask of you, do you mind using headphones when you take work calls during the day\" might be helpful. I would avoid talking about client sensitivity etc at all. After all, that's not really your issue. I've been living in sharehouses for the past 15 years and I find that those are the two best strategies. If you approach it as a compatibility issue where you're trying to find a solution that works for you both, you're much more likely to have success than if you try to argue about what is or isn't normal\/acceptable\/reasonable. A final note, I'm not sure which country you're in, but where I live (Australia) using the word \"annoying\" in this context would be more likely to make someone defensive. I would focus on expressing your preference\/desire rather than talking about feeling annoyed. Good luck!","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28669","post_title":"How to let a roomate know that their speakerphone is loud and I can hear it?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28669","timestamp":"2024-03-19T13:49:59","char_len":1570,"word_len":274,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"The problem isn't that your roommate uses the kitchen too much, the problem is you both want to use it at the same time. If she only cooked for thirty minutes a day, but it was during your break from work, then you'd still have a problem. Cooking for thirty minutes a day would be completely reasonable, and it'd be unreasonable to ask for it to be less, so simply asking for her to spend less time cooking isn't a great solution. It increases the chance you won't have a timing conflict, but it doesn't guarantee it. Plus it completely ignores that your roommate is cooking that much for a reason, so she's not likely to agree to stop. The actual issue is you need a way to resolve it when you both want to cook at the same time. A schedule could work, but neither of you want that. That pretty much leaves resolving it on a case-by-case basis. I rent out a room in my house, so this is something I run into frequently. We generally resolve it using these techniques: If you're going to making something elaborate, you warn other people ahead of time so everyone can plan around it or raise an objection If someone will be needing the kitchen at a predictable time (you regularly cook before leaving for work or on a lunch break, etc), then everyone else avoids using it at that time If someone else is using the kitchen when you want it, ask how much longer they'll be. If it's a few minutes, just wait for them to be done. If it'll be longer and you just want to put on a pot to boil, ask them if you can do so. It's generally not an issue, most things can stop being stirred for a moment If you need something from a cupboard when someone else is in the kitchen, say excuse me and grab it when they move Yes, you will have to talk to each other. Yes, it means the kitchen will not always be available when you want it and you might have to wait a bit if you don't plan ahead. That's the reality of sharing a space with someone though. Another option could be a sign-up sheet that you only fill out a day in advance, to accommodate shifting schedules. If nobody is signed up for a time, then the kitchen is open for anyone to use, but if someone does sign up, then everyone else avoids using it during that time. Obviously only reserve it for times you'll definitely be using it. I've never tried this for sharing a kitchen, but it works well for meeting rooms, and it's essentially solving the same problem.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26585","post_title":"My roommate cooks so much I don&#39;t get a turn with the kitchen","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/26585","timestamp":"2020-12-28T05:15:13","char_len":2439,"word_len":459,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Just be a normal person and share the space. The kitchen is as much yours as it is the roommate's. Simply say: Hey I'll get in here and cook some of my stuff, may you please make a little room for me on the counter. Move around each other and say nice words like \" excuse me \" or \" right behind you \" or \" I have to rinse this\/that when you are done in the sink \", or \" I'm about to put the dirty dishes in the sink, do you need to rinse or soak something? \"... So many roommate problems happen when people get offended because they are too entitled or uncomfortable to speak to the person they LIVE with. If you are having problems with your roommate because the roommate is cooking, then it seems that the problem is bigger than cooking in the kitchen is the outlet for the misplaced anger\/miscommunication towards the roommate. Cooking is a basic necessity, if you or your roommate have time to make that an issue, that speaks more to the quality of human being a person is than an actual problem.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26585","post_title":"My roommate cooks so much I don&#39;t get a turn with the kitchen","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/26585","timestamp":"2020-12-28T05:15:13","char_len":1010,"word_len":193,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"You cannot achieve this goal. This is partly because you can't, in general, get people as a whole to do anything. But for this particular case, it is because society has very strongly trained women to be super gentle and careful and not direct at all when rejecting men. Women who reject men directly get killed. Not every time, but it happens. The headlines make it clear: That\u2019s It. She Said No Take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer A 16-Year-old repeatedly rejected a coworker's advances I could find you dozens more, but you get the point. We all see these headlines. We all know this is a possibility. You cannot reassure a person that you're not going to murder them if they say no. (Imagine: \"it's cool if you don't want to, I won't find you and kill you for saying no.\" Ew!) You cannot undo a lifetime of socialization and upraising. I am sure it seems to you that dating is super hard because you can't be sure if she's interested or not, and it feels unfair, and you wish they would be more open. For the women, they can't be sure if you're safe or not. They really really don't want to upset you. As Margaret Atwood says: Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them. I can give you some unsolicited advice, though. Like the line about consent that says \"hold out for enthusiasm\" I can tell you that if someone really wants to spend time with you, you'll know. Make suggestions, suggest times, but if the enthusiasm isn't there, understand that is the \"no\" you are looking for. Don't be leaving gaps in your schedule because someone from coffee three weeks ago said \"that sounds like it might be fun sometime\" in response to a suggestion you made.

People like to be with those who can make them feel comfortable. Demanding or controlling people (my way or the highway) make everyone uncomfortable.

{"comment_text":"I've been in a situation where I was a good student going a bit bad and threatening to drop studies because of depression. I have a mental illness which usually strikes in teenage and spike in early twenties. While I am unsure if our two cases relate since little is known about your friend real problem, I believe I can advise on a few pointers on how to help. I would first advise to take the case seriously. Depressed people are hard to care about and capable of the worst. Sometimes the cause is a difficult breakup, difficult situation in the family, sometimes the cause is inner like mine. Provided you can't send him straight to a professional, the important thing is to be there where he needs like you did on the phone. Isolation usually worsen depression. Altered self worth might make him feel he doesn't deserve your attention, try also to offset this feeling by recalling him from time to time he counts for you. The remaining is more hypothetically helpful, but it could also be more efficient if it lands well. If you know his family well and believe they can treat the situation in an adequate manner you could also warn them something is going wrong. They could on their turn also try to break isolation. Be careful to not break your friend trust doing so, however. You could suggest him to see a therapist if such things are adequate in your culture and are practicaly accessible. I know that many would take offense for being suggested that so take some care choosing your words; try to relate to undeniable facts that lead you to believe he could benefit. Among the activity you could do together, sports can also be helpful in fighting negative thinking. This is what I would have benefited from, in some of my worst periods and I hope it can help you taking care of your friend.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"26106","post_title":"How to get close to an old friend, who is struggling with his situation now","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/26106","timestamp":"2020-09-03T06:38:46","char_len":1814,"word_len":325,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"If you want to interact with them directly I don't think you can absolutely avoid being mocked. If you don't know the people you're talking to, there's no way to guess how they'll react to any sort of interaction. If they seem generally jovial, though, I wouldn't be too concerned about it. People are generally reasonable as long as you act reasonably with them. So, rather than being stern or demanding, be lighthearted and maybe a bit teasing. They may simply be unaware at how loud they're being. I've found that saying something like Hey, y'all, I've really enjoyed getting to take part in your discussion but I'd like to focus on my book now; would you be so kind as to take the volume down a few decibels? can generally yield less annoyed compliance. The important thing is to say this (or something along these lines that you're comfortable with\/fits the situation) with a smile and be very open with them... and say it while the staff is nearby, so if they do start to react negatively, you can hope for an assist from the server. And, if they do react negatively, remember, that's not your fault . They're the ones being disruptive and you're making a reasonable request and attempting to solve it yourself - which is OK - but you don't need to. Asking your server or the manager to either ask them to be quieter or reseat you farther away from them is perfectly reasonable, particularly if the place is otherwise empty.

{"comment_text":"I find more moments I could have kept my mouth shut after the fact... Many friends have suggested that I need to talk less, give shorter answers... Both 'no second date' and 'no second interview' can be caused by a mismatch that neither talking nor silence can fix . But I think you've found the correct problem. You recognize it, you can improve on it. What are some strategies I can use to slow down and say less? The first thing is to consider why you need to do it. Thinking about \"why\", can help with the \"how\". For both job interviews and dates Talking too much: Creates a bad first impression. Either it shows you aren't interested in them, or you come across as anxious . Anxious is better, but isn't good. Keeps you from making a personal connection. You want them to develop a personal connection to you. Causes you to miss opportunities. How will you discover shared interests, or common ground when they aren't talking? Can cause an interview\/date to run long Often they'll cut it short before asking you everything they want to know. You aren't the best candidate if they don't have their answers. Strategies: Balance is the key. Give relevant information without unnecessary details. Those friends you mentioned - practice this with them. Practicing in normal social situations is lower pressure, and you can encourage them if they offer you feedback. You can also, if you're brave, ask \"At what point just now, did you think I was going on too long?\" Might be earlier than you think. (Don't forget to thank them. Because they may stop doing if they don't get encouragement.) Specific to Job interviews - I have attended a lot of them over the past twenty plus years. I have been part of an interview team more than once. What it takes to succeed in a job interview varies based on: the position you're interviewing for, the industry it is in, and the person\/people interviewing you. Although jobs vary, I'd say 'talking too much' is likely one of the universal ways to fail a job interview (showing disrespect is another). Maybe you won't fail for talking too much, it still bad. I try to keep the following in mind when I interview: Respond to only the question asked. Briefly verbalize relevant skills\/qualifications, then stop talking . If they want you to elaborate, they will ask you a follow up question. If the question is about you (\"Tell me about yourself\") Have a few sentences memorized in advance that answer it briefly. Recite what you've memorized and stop talking . This is the toughest type of question for your issue because there are no guardrails to keep you on track, and no stop sign. The goal of an interview is to appear as though you are someone who can and will do the work. If I think you will spend your day telling stories to other employees, I can't hire you because then I have two people who aren't working (you + your target). Answering a question with a story is sometimes appropriate. If you answer with a story and you find yourself moving on to a different story - that should be a big warning flag to yourself. Circling back to an earlier part the story - also a flag. (I've made that mistake more than once.) If you notice while you are doing it , it probably isn't too late. Pause and recover: Stop talking immediately. Yes... even in the middle of a sentence! Take a slow breath. Address the issue. Example: \"I'm sorry, have I already answered the question well enough? I don't want to go too long.\" This puts them back in control. They can either move to the next topic or ask a follow-up question based on your answer.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28615","post_title":"Strategies for talking less on dates or job interviews","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28615","timestamp":"2024-01-29T02:42:59","char_len":3702,"word_len":642,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"TLDR: You shouldn't From a friendship standpoint: If he showed you his music because he's proud of it, then your job as a friend is to support him. Tearing him down by saying his music sucks will not only damage his confidence and drive that is so vital to a musician, but also potentially damage the friendship. Sure, his music may be unpleasant to listen to, and you may really dislike it, but he felt comfortable enough to be vulnerable enough to show you his creation. I don't see any benefit that either of you get from you saying his music is bad. From a critical standpoint: If he showed you his music, and explicitly asked for constructive criticism, then that gives you full right to critically comment on his work. However, you should focus on providing constructive pointers along the lines of: \"I really like your flow in this verse, but you seem to be relying on triplet beats (something common in trap\/SoundCloud rap). But you have good lyrical ideas!\" \"Your beat has this super dark feeling to it, which really compliments the song's theme. It feels somewhat repetitive though at times, perhaps a key change or bridge section would improve the track.\" From a genre perspective, you could even suggest that he experiments with new sounds and styles outside of SoundCloud rap. Currently, the trap and SoundCloud subgenres seem to be really saturated with similar-sounding artists. He may even stand out to others more if he incorporates other styles into his music. This shows that you actually listened and internalized his music, and provided thoughtful and supportive feedback. Even if he doesn't heed your advice, he still will value that you, his friend, care enough about him to partake in his creative endeavors. Overall, music and music taste is so incredibly subjective, and you being an avid music fan probably understand this. What you may think is trash, may not be what he thinks is trash. You purely saying to him, \"Your music sucks\", \"Your lyrics are garbage\", \"Your beats are trash\", etc. can be easily dismissed by him with \"Well, that's your opinion\", \"You're just a hater\", \"Fine, then you write your own music\", etc. To summarize, your friend will internalize better and benefit from the constructive criticism. If you truly want your opinion to come across well, this will be the better approach. Sidenote: I have been playing guitar for about 15 years now, and understand how long it takes to hone a craft. Three to four years into my music career, I was playing badly . Now, I crave the advice and feedback from fellow musicians as that'll only help me improve, but the support from friends and family early on was crucial to me. Knowing my friends were in my corner supporting me helped me want to grow and improve as a musician. Who knows, maybe someday your friend will become a really skilled rapper, or even famous? However, he won't get there with you constantly putting him down, and if he does, surely that bridge will be burned along the way.

{"comment_text":"The way you answer boils down to your own level of \"expertise\" in music, particularly in this genre. Are you an aficionado who could give constructive feedback on how to improve the music, or (despite your avid fandom) are you still just an dedicated listener who knows what you like, but can't really articulate why? In the end, unfortunately, anything you say might be hurtful. There's no way around that when criticizing someone's artistic effort. They may feel they poured their heart and soul into the work, and then you come along and shred it, or dismiss it thoughtlessly. But let's assume you know enough to give expert advice, and your goal is to help them understand what's doesn't work, so they can go back and make it work. If that's the case, you might \"pre-frame\" the discussion by getting permission to be honest: Let me ask you this: Do you just want my approval, or are you looking for serious artistic feedback? As anyone who's been to art school knows, other artists are not shy about laying into your art, brutally criticizing anything they might see as a flaw. A good artist accepts this and learns to take it with equanimity. Not all criticism is valid, but even the most gratuitous can contain some grain of truth that helps them improve. It's a tough, but ultimately rewarding process. If your friend is willing to get kicked around a bit, then you can soften the blow by prefacing the negative criticism with something positive. For example: I like the way that you strung together the lyrics in this phrase -- but, I have to tell you, they don't flow with that beat at all. You need to think about mixing up your rhythms to let the music be part of your unique voice, and not just background noise. As you might expect you should avoid saying things like, \"That's utter trash!\" not because they're mean-spirited but because they don't contain any actionable information. Which is to say, don't sugar-coat everything, but do ultimately give constructive advice that to encourage them to try harder. All this assumes you're willing to put in the time to help, of course. This can take hours or even days, so be sure you are OK getting sucked in before you move forward. On the other hand, if you don't want to take the time, or they don't seem to want your brutal honesty, or (as mentioned at the beginning) you don't feel you're expert enough to give an informed opinion, you can dissemble: Well, I listened to your music, but I don't think I'm really the right person to judge it as your style isn't really my cup of tea. You should ask someone who is into that style. If they counter that they know you are into \"SoundCloud rap\" and that doesn't make sense, you can try to draw some fine distinctions between what you like and what you don't: Yes, I know. But I'm into music that has kind of jazzy, complex, upbeat rhythms. Yours is more dark, which already turns me off to it. But other people might get into that. Try to stay honest by stating what you don't like about it, e.g. \"it's too downbeat\", \"it's too slow\", \"you're not really rapping about things that interest me\", and so on. This allows them to understand what it is that you didn't like, but suggests it's just a personal , and not a general opinion. If nothing like that comes to mind, fall back on something innocuous and meaningless: I'm sorry, I just couldn't get into it. This might not work, as your friend is likely to press for details, but it is less unfriendly than stating your actual opinion.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17898","post_title":"How to tell a friend their music is awful?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17898","timestamp":"2018-08-23T19:18:19","char_len":3576,"word_len":629,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I fail to understand why my suggested reply is rude, and on the other hand, find the suggestion dishonest and therefore inappropriate. There is nothing rude about this response, so your understanding makes perfect sense. What is a polite way to turn down your brother's who lives next door dessert invitation? You do exactly what you were about to respond with: \"Thank you, but I don't feel like eating strudel right now.\" As a person on the autism spectrum, I've frequently been told that what I'm saying may be rude, but in my personal experience it has turned out to not be interpreted by the other person as such. There's someone else who's written about this exact scenario on their personal blog, in the post Six Rules Regarding Autistic Interaction : 3. It is always okay to say no to someone else rather than to create a fictitious excuse for why you can\u2019t do something with a friend. [...] To an autistic person, it\u2019s not what you say that hurts, it\u2019s whether you mean it. The truth never hurts, but lies and deception do. [...] I once went out to see a movie with a person my age that was on the autism spectrum. She was totally shut down during the movie, and clearly didn\u2019t want to be there. Although I understood what she was going through, my mother felt that, in order to be polite, I should call her up and ask to get together again. When I did, the girl told me that she had plans all week and thus could not see me. When it was later revealed that the real reason was because she did not like seeing that movie with me and she was also trying to be polite, I was furious. I felt as if she had betrayed me, and my feelings were hurt. This was not because she had rejected me, but because she had to lie about it. If she could be honest, then I would not have felt hurt. (While their blog post specifically refers to autistic people, based on my personal experience, I've found that this \"rule\" - and some other rules - apply equally to non-autistic - neurotypical - people, especially the above quoted part of whether you mean something that hurts.) Based on their experience and mine, I've often found that lying to a person as to why I couldn't do something causes hurt, especially if they later somehow find out the real reason, whereas being more direct is either simply accepted (80% of the time) or initially comes off as off-putting but they eventually understand within a few minutes (the other 20% of the time).","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"27920","post_title":"How do I politely reject my brother&#39;s morning dessert invitation?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/27920","timestamp":"2022-08-21T08:44:49","char_len":2470,"word_len":448,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"Intro Your reply isn't rude, but your reply doesn't match the tone of the message you recieved. Since this is your brother then it would typically be standard to reply back using conversation that aligns more with restricted code over elaborated code. Restricted code This is speech that is dependant on context, relying on the shared understanding between an in-group. This type of language reflects familarity and is typically considered \"warm\". This also allows for less verbose speech for easier and faster communication. For example this was a past text message conversation between me and a roommate (male,platonic)(certain details removed to protect identities\/privacy). This is an example of a question and answer using restricted code: roommate: Can u go in the draw on my desk the long one pause and get the <restaurant> menu me: Cant send images to <phone brand\/model> roommate: I just need the number to them me: <phone number> roommate: Preciate it As can be seen in this conversation there are almost no formalities used except at the end of the request. Text is economical, providing exactly the information needed. It sounds like a conversation would sound. Other parts represented in this type of speech are use of written asides\/jokes: long one pause And use of Eye Dialect Preciate it Elaborated code This is speech that is not dependant on context and can be understand by anyone regardless of whether they are in-group or out-group. The point of this speech is to ensure understanding, but is rarely used between family members. For example, this is a text conversation using elaborated code between me and a job recruiter (details removed to protect identity\/privacy). recruiter: Hello Maximilian, this is <Recruitor's Name> with <Company1>. I received your application for the position of <job>. Are you still interested in this position? [...] My apologies. I accepted a position at another company. No worries. Thank you for responding. As you can see this conversation has a liberal use of formalities and can be understand without almost any context needed. The conversation is obviously between two strangers and there is not a shared upon agreement for lexicon, dialect, tone, etc to be used. Since there is no context for this conversation it will be as general as possible to ensure the maximum amount of people may understand what is being said and as well as being as curteous as possible to minimize chance of offendending. The Question Directed At You (Restricted Code) The text you recieved uses similar level of restricted code in comparison with my first example: Come get some strudel The meaning of this is completely dependant on the shared context between you and your brother. It matches the level of restricted code typically seen in English between people of the same family, and may be a little more concise than spoken word because of the medium (text). Your Reponse To This Question (Elaborated Code) Your reply on the other hand utilizies more elaborated code than restricted code: Thank you, but I don't feel like eating strudel right now Not only does this create dissonance in tone of the conversation due to the mismatch of code used, it also may even convey a level of distance in how you view your relationship with your brother. Examples of why this is elaborated speech include: use of the character , , verbose phrase usage \"thank you\" rather than \"thanks\". I am going to elaborated though more specifically about a particularly dissonate detail in your reply: I don't feel like eating strudel right now This is an elaboration that is verbose since the context with what you want to do with said strudel is understood and does not need to be said, the example of this phrase in restricted language would be: I don't feel like strudel right now This would not effect tone much if not for how it also works to avoid use of mimicry in regards to verb usage, the question was get some Strudel The response elaborates needlessly and inserts verb that is different and more clear to the restricted code use of get some . Reply That Matches Restricted Code I do not know the exact relationship you have with your brother, however since he initiated with the first message using a liberal amount of restricted code and since he is a direct family member, I would assume you would want to reply back in restricted code and with the same type of tone. There are many ways to say this and it will depend on your relationship and shared lexicon\/ dialect between you and your brother, however the words thanks and good are generally what the main words should be in your reply (in most circumstances). I think the reply that would best fit in this circumstance would be: Nah im good This is a phrase I use liberally and have never been called rude when I use it in informal situations that warrant restricted code. Linked as well is the urban dictionary entry for \"nah im good\", which has 91 upvotes and 10 downvotes with the first definition being: A casual way of saying \"No thanks\" However, if that is not your style then here are a few more examples that may work: Im good , Im good thanks , Im good thanks though Thanks but im good Im fine right now Nah im good for right now Not feeling strudel rn Nah im not feeling strudel rn Nah im chillin Further Reading https:\/\/communication.binus.ac.id\/2016\/02\/09\/what-you-need-to-know-about-elaborated-and-restricted-codes\/","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"27920","post_title":"How do I politely reject my brother&#39;s morning dessert invitation?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/27920","timestamp":"2022-08-21T08:44:49","char_len":5610,"word_len":917,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I communicate a lot online, especially in chatrooms - often on Stack Exchange chat itself, or Discord, or similar platforms, and have been using these platforms to communicate for years. I'm often sarcastic - I like incorporating sarcasm into my communication, and it doesn't help that I like to at times provide \"comic relief\" of sorts. I'm used to people assuming that what I'm saying is sarcasm, because a lot of the time, it is. A good way that I've found to differentiate between when you're being sarcastic and when not is to incorporate a specific writing style for being sarcastic, and a different one for being serious. This happened rather naturally for me, simply as a result of being misunderstood a bit too often - it sort of developed as a defense mechanism. If I'm being sarcastic, I'll often trail off sentences with an ellipsis at the end, and in general adopt a dry, familiar tone. Emphasis on words like \" much better\" also helps with replicating normal tones for speaking sarcastically. Throwing in emojis like \";)\" are also commonplace. Speaking in absolutes also often gives a sarcastic tone. Compare: Sure... ;) Yeah, it would've been much better if they'd have killed her off at the end... vs Sure. Seriously, it would've been better if they had killed her off at the end - it would've resolved the storyline with this guy, and given some resolution to the character. When I'm not being sarcastic, my tone gets less dry. I sound more like I mean what I'm saying. Drop the emojis. Drop the ellipsis at the end. Sound more \"serious\". Flesh out what you're saying. For extra benefit, throw on a \"seriously\" at the beginning, especially if you're switching from being joking \/ sarcastic to being serious, or use another similar method (\"on a more serious note\", \"to be serious for a sec\", etc). What you wrote - \"I agree. Especially if your anime were going to be filler-ridden anyway\" - has several things in it that make it sound like you're being sarcastic. First off, you wrote \"I agree\". That immediately sounds sarcastic. (I'm not even sure why, but it does. It for some reason immediately gives me the impress that you're not being serious.) If I were you, I'd've thrown on a \"seriously\" at the beginning. Second, you're degrading the thing you're talking about, in a way. \"filler-ridden\" gives the impression that you're being sarcastic because you're putting it down without explaining what you mean, or giving your reasoning. If I were in your position, I would have gone for something more like this. Seriously, I agree. It already has lots of filler in it, which is Toei's specialty, so it would actually be a good idea. While there's still the possibility of this being misinterpreted as being sarcastic, from my experience this will be much less likely now that you're explaining your reasoning, and leading with something (\"seriously\") that should explicitly tell them that you're not being sarcastic. While there's no sureproof way to make sure that you're never taken sarcastically when you're not, in my experience, the best way is to adopt a certain way that you use to communicate in each instance, and avoid using communication methods that are usually seen as sarcastic when you're being serious. This will work best with people who you communicate with often and have learned your style of communication, but I've had success in using my two methods of communication even with people who I am not in regular contact with. As an aside, cultural and language barriers often play an often underestimated role when it comes to sarcasm and communication on the internet. People who don't speak English as a first language often have a hard time picking up on the subtleties that come into play in English, and people who do speak English as a first language sometimes read stuff into other people's messages that the person who wrote the message didn't mean at all. Other cultural considerations, such as not generally using sarcasm at all, can also have an impact on understanding. It's something to keep in mind. Always be ready to explain yourself, and don't be too quick to jump to conclusions, especially if the other person isn't a native speaker.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"22471","post_title":"How can I indicate that what I&#39;m saying is not sarcastic online?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/22471","timestamp":"2019-07-22T04:25:28","char_len":4263,"word_len":717,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I replied that \"I agree. Especially if your anime were going to be filler-ridden anyway\". I actually agree that Toei should have made it because they know how to make an anime with filler bearable or even good, not sarcasm that means Toei is a bad choice because Toei only made anime full of fillers. But my message was interpreted as the latter. I don't think there's a specific way to indicate a lack of sarcasm online, that's similar to how you can indicate sarcasm using \/s, \/sarcasm or italics . You can, however, change the tone of your message to sound less sarcastic. Your reply sounds the way I'd use to indicate sarcasm in real-life sentences, with words like 'especially', 'filler-ridden' and 'anyway'. Wikihow lists a few characteristics of sarcasm, and your sentence matches some of them: Overly positive or negative language: 'filler-ridden' sounds much more negative than 'with filler' for example. It sounds critical: The combination of 'especially' and 'anyway' in one sentence sounds like you're critical, that you're aware of the studio's infamy for using filler. So, get rid of that part of your phrasing. Rephrase your sentence, avoid the overly positive, the overly negative, the critical part. Let people know you know the studio is infamous for creating anime with filler, but that you think they do a better job at making those than a random other studio, so moving the production would at least make that part of the anime better. Tell them exactly like you told us in your explanation of your reply. Yes, that's a lot more words and explanation, but it also leaves a lot less up to people's imagination and will help with preventing misunderstandings.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"22471","post_title":"How can I indicate that what I&#39;m saying is not sarcastic online?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/22471","timestamp":"2019-07-22T04:25:28","char_len":1702,"word_len":284,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Some background about me I've been in the shoes of the girl. I had to move out, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to move in together (we've been together for 3 years at that point), and he refused. He loved me, but he was living alone at the time and didn't want to give up that up yet. We moved in together 2 years later. My response I would be honest with her, and as soon as possible. Although you two never had a real discussion about living together, from your comment it seems there's a real possibility she thinks she'll move in with you. If she has already started the moving out process in her current apartment, things will be much harder, so tell her quickly ! There's nothing wrong or shameful about your desire to live alone, so I'd be honest with her and tell her what you've told us: that you love her, and see a future with her, but that you'd like to live on your own for a while before moving in with her. That you absolutely want to live with her at some point, just not right now. Some tips and remarks : 1\/ People take their cues from you . If you're nervous in a conversation, you'll make the other person nervous. If you talk about something terribly, they'll think something terrible is happening. If you're calm and warm, you'll put the other person at ease, and convey that there's no problem here, let's just chat. So don't be negative : don't apologize non stop, don't degrade yourself. Be warm and loving, and then keep the focus of the conversation on your reasons for wanting this, and not insisting it isn't her (when someone says \"it's not you, it's me\", the other person always thinks the opposite). 2\/ This is a discussion . Once you've said your piece, hear her out. Listen. She'll be at least a little hurt, and she has a right to express this. This doesn't mean you're a terrible person and that you should grovel at her feet and apologize. But she deserves to be heard and to have her feelings validated. You'll also be able to reassure her more effectively. 3\/ Take the opportunity to talk more broadly about the future . Having some plans, a timeline, or just knowing you're both on the same page (but that it will just take a bit more time to get there) could reassure her. But without this, I think it's important you two have a big talk about your future, because something tells me you've not really done that (hinting around living together, being \"pretty sure\" she loves you). 4\/ Maybe ask her about her own experience, being able to live more independently (she didn't live alone, but having roommates is very different from living with family or a significant other). Back to me What helped me when my boyfriend told me he didn't want to live with me was him being kind, warm, telling me he loves me and explaining why he likes to live alone (the wording is important : it's not \"I don't want to live with you\" but \"I like to live alone\", the focus is on him, not on me). It still hurt, but at the end of the discussion I was secure in our relationship and I knew that he wanted us to live together, just not now. I was also able to express my needs, my insecurities and what I wished for the future (I didn't want to wait 5 years to live together, we wanted kids so there was a timeline, and he agreed with me).","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"20193","post_title":"How to politely tell my girlfriend that I want to live on my own for some time","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/20193","timestamp":"2018-12-07T12:27:13","char_len":3291,"word_len":616,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I think your desire to live on your own is completely understandable, I was in a similar situation until a few years back when I moved out of my parents and bought my own place. I don't think this desire would be completely foreign to your girlfriend either although I can see how there could be some conflicting emotions that could confuse her. I think this could be largely avoided if you prepared a list of how living on your own would benefit the relationship in the long run, this way you are showing her that this is not a decision you are taking lightly and that you have your future with her in mind when you are thinking about this. Some of the benefits I would expect you could gain from living alone is that you get a better appreciation of how much work goes into maintaining a clean home, you certainly wouldn't want to move in together and end up constantly fighting about \"that mess in the corner\" or some such. You also get an appreciation for cooking and grocery shopping, setting your own budget for all these new expenses and managing your time on your own. I'm sure there are more things I'm forgetting, basically think of all the responsibilities your parents and grandparents help to take care of at home, you don't want to move out without having experience taking on those responsibilities yourself. I think Euchris's idea of a deadline could help however as you mention you may still not feel ready to move in together and you don't want to feel like you've broken a commitment so instead of a deadline I would say schedule fairly regular check ins where you and your girlfriend will sit down and talk about how you're both feeling about moving in again. This way you're not breaking any commitment if you're not ready and shows that you don't want this to be a closed conversation.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"20193","post_title":"How to politely tell my girlfriend that I want to live on my own for some time","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/20193","timestamp":"2018-12-07T12:27:13","char_len":1823,"word_len":327,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"tl;dr: I see two good options: be direct, explaining to your girlfriend your desire to have the experience of living on your own, or be oblique and talk about living alone in a way that allows for a discussion. The direct approach: I love you and want our relationship to keep progressing, but I feel like I need to have experienced living on my own, at least for a while. The direct approach is attractive because it is clear, leaving less room for (mis)interpretation on your girlfriend's part. Even if you are concerned that she will feel hurt, those concerns are non-unique to this approach. Any sort of lie, evasion, or excuse carries the exact same risks, plus the risk of additional hurt as a result of your indirection. If what you are worried about is that she will be upset you are not moving in together, and she in fact would be upset, there will be no way to avoid that if you live by yourself. I say this not to suggest that you are guaranteed to hurt your girlfriend, but that the effects of your decision will exist no matter what approach you take if the overall scenario is one she doesn't like. The indirect approach: I don't recommend this, because there are a thousand ways that your girlfriend could read things into the situation that you did not intend, and you won't necessarily be privy to that information (and therefore won't be able to account for\/improve things). But, if you don't want to inform her of why your preference for living alone right now exists, you can casually talk about your new apartment, plans you have for it, etc. It will be important to be ready for a conversation-- if your girlfriend objects to things, or has questions, you will need to address them or else risk appearing dismissive and uninterested in her. That will cause additional strain on your relationship, beyond this issue in itself. You may want to proactively ask about her feelings, to avoid her quietly nurturing some unhappiness, but this will quickly turn into (1) anyways, in which case you may as well be direct from the outset. An additional risk to being indirect is ending up with your girlfriend as an informal roommate. If you maintain separate residences, but she comes over to your new place five nights a week, you may not get the \"living on your own\" experience you're wanting. And if you have a problem with her coming over so often, you'll need to explain why (failing to do so again risks lots of misunderstandings, which won't help your relationship). That, again, brings us back to (1). Background: Your worries are understandable, but are probably less pressing than you imagine. Living independently is a valuable experience, and time to yourself is important. First, the social expectation that you are \"supposed\" to move in with your girlfriend by now is far from absolute. There are a lot of people that would find it scandalous and inappropriate for you two to move in together while unmarried at any point, and a lot of people that would think it's crazy you hadn't moved in together after dating for a much shorter period of time. The only perspectives that really matter are yours and your girlfriend's. You're not required to live together at any point while dating, and my personal experience is that while cohabiting is pretty common among people by the time they reach your age many of those people regret doing so as quickly as they did. That you feel you are \"supposed\" to move in together because of some arbitrary criterion is a terrible reason to move in together. That probably won't remove the sense of pressure you may feel, but to the extent that you are able to not consider that feeling in making your decisions you will likely be better off. There is nothing to feel ashamed about here. Second, while it's important to tend to your girlfriend and your relationship with her (those are separate considerations, by the way), you also need to tend to yourself. Having a need, or even a strong preference, isn't something you need to dismiss only because it's \"just\" for you personally. That's not to say that you should pursue your own self-interest at all times no matter what, but you don't need to feel guilty about wanting something for yourself. The wrinkle here is that you have been \"slower to launch\" than your girlfriend. While living outside of your parents' house will be a new experience for you, your girlfriend has already done so for years. There are a lot of benefits to staying with your parents as you have done (presumably convenience and financial benefits), but it's unreasonable to expect that you can claim those benefits without any tradeoffs at all. If it turns out to be really important to your girlfriend that you move in together soon, you may have \"missed\" your opportunity to live alone while still dating her. Living alone is something that you want, generally; relationship items are things that your girlfriend needs from you, specifically. These aren't symmetrical. If your girlfriend is fine with you living alone for a year or two, after which you start living together, then everything's great. If she's eager for your relationship to advance to living together, she may not be excited to delay things to accommodate the conveniences you've already enjoyed. A major benefit of the direct approach is that you can find out about her feelings immediately, and address them as needed. Your desire seems reasonable to me, but your girlfriend's desires count as well. If you living alone at this point bothers her, but you insist on doing it anyways, then it's a natural consequence that your relationship will suffer a bit. It boils down to whether or not she wants this now, and if so how badly she wants it. Talking to her is the only way you're going to be able to determine and address these things.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"20193","post_title":"How to politely tell my girlfriend that I want to live on my own for some time","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/20193","timestamp":"2018-12-07T12:27:13","char_len":5836,"word_len":1012,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"First and foremost, I'll talk only about the \" human part \" of the problem your describe. There are legal options you should be aware of (like the hereditary reserved portion or the parents\/children legal obligations) and only a lawyer can explain the issues and give advice. As unfair as it can be in your point of view, you have to try and step in your parents' shoes to have a deeper (better?) insight. During my life, I've witnessed some family business close to what you live right now. Here's what I learnt\/understood from it (this is raw material, I'm not taking side here): parents aren't always wise (especially the way children would want them to be). parents can have favourite children and treat them differently. parents have a tendency to protect the \" weaker of the pack \". parents often help the one they think is needy. parents don't like to be taught by children or told what they should do. out of sight, out of mind. At the moment, I'm pretty sure that they really think they're taking the best decision, how blatant the injustice can seem\/be to you. Even if the other children might be hurt by their decisions and attitude, they'll probably stand their ground because they \" know better \", and it's their decision. This can last as long (for ever?) as they wish, unless they decide to change their mind. Can you influence them and change that? I doubt it, as no one of us could (for any unrelated topics, yet serious ones too), in our family, nor could the ones I witnessed over the years. What happened was that people were slowly parting ways and it was driving a wedge in the family. Worse, it was the children's fault if that happened. Because they couldn't understand, and because of many many other reasons, like selfishness and alike... What I did was just express my feelings, and let them know, in a short way, something like that: Sorry, but what you did just badly hurts me. I find it completely unfair. Not more, not less. No explanation, no pros and cons, no judgement of value other than expressing a feeling, it's \" unfair to me \". My best advice would be to not argue, with any of them (parents or brother), as it will only make things worse and add bitterness to an already less than sweet relationship. You already tried, and they swept it away, why would any other argument change their mind? Is there a risk that you'll loosen and sour the relationship and have a lot less interactions with them? Yes. Distance and time help a little at healing the wound, that may be what you need right now. There's no \" it worked for [whoever] and it will for you too \" way of acting, because we're dealing with different personalities and interactions (see @Duke-Leto great explanation about another POV when stepping in someone else's shoes). We can only share experience and thoughts based on our own pasts, so that it puts another light on the problem. Do what's best for your well-being and own sake at the moment, we can't decide what's best for you though...","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28124","post_title":"My parents are going to disinherit me.

{"comment_text":"One of my children is fluent in Mandarin while not looking as though he might be. This has resulted in multiple situations where he thought someone was talking to him and has responded, to tremendous surprise. Eg on a bus, the person next to him, heads down going through a backpack, \"want a bottle of water?\" and he politely said \"no thankyou\" and it turned out they were talking to a companion on the other side of him, a little conversation in Mandarin and some seat swapping to put the companions together, all good. When he doesn't accidentally think they're talking to him, he completely ignores it, including controlling his facial expressions. He has more than once been surprised by the very personal conversations people have in public when they think no-one understands. But telling them he understands them (has been understanding them all this time) is only going to embarrass and upset them. Reading his book or playing on his phone gives them their illusion of privacy, and since he doesn't care about the things he's learning, there is no real loss of privacy. This wouldn't apply for a coworker or someone else you might see again, of course. Finally, there are times when the things he understood were about him and directed at him by someone who didn't know he could understand. The landlord who berated an agent for bringing a white person (she used a slur) to look at an apartment, for example. On that occasion he replied to the landlord, something like \"I'm not like most of them\" and she freaked out saying that a [slur] who could understand her was even worse and throwing them both off the property. From that he learned that discretion may not improve situations, but at least it doesn't worsen them.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"28597","post_title":"How can I politely indicate that I know Spanish (or any other language)?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/28597","timestamp":"2024-01-16T06:21:19","char_len":1731,"word_len":301,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"This is an incredibly hard question to deal with both online and in real life. There are a lot of variables at play, and it's extremely difficult for a given person to identify which of those matter, the exact circumstances you're encountering, etc. Someone might well be able to give very generic and obvious advice (like \"get new hobbies\"). Besides, people may not even have a strong, conscious understanding of what they respond to\/do that other people respond to. And if they don't know, they can't just tell you. But even if someone gives you ten things to do, and you do them, there's no particular reason to think these are substantial and decisive things that will produce the results you want. It is, in my opinion, extremely unlikely that these sorts of troubles are due to a handful of distinct, discrete \"things\", like (for example) liking D&D rather than SoulCycle. Anything specific that I suggest is, at best, a guess which may have nothing at all to do with your specific situation. That said, I have two broad strategies that might be of some use. The Cyrano Review It's hard to properly convey the real context and events of what you're doing when you are trying to get or impress a date, especially when drawing from the things that you noticed and remembered (you already know all that stuff!). But if you have someone who you think might have some good advice, having them nearby so they can see for themselves can bring a lot more of that context in. This could be as open as a group event where you're all together the whole time, or as removed as a friend who goes to the same bar as you and checks in on things once in a while. Later your friend can talk to you about things. If you make an obvious misstep, you can get an honest report of it. If you miss an opportunity, they might be able to point it out to you. And there's no guessing about what signals you might imagine she sent (or did not send). If your date is just not a good match for you in terms of personality or interests, you can hear that (hopefully) unbiased report and know that there may not have been much else you could have done. The Non-Date Perspective It's been my observation that dating is not as different from other relationships as many people seem to think. There are some differences, of course, but someone who is able to attract people for totally platonic, non-date activities is probably someone who will also be able to attract people for dates as well . With that in mind you don't need to be entirely focused on dates . You can aim to improve your social skills in dating-relevant areas without actually needing the scenario (and attendant pressures) of dates or trying to get dates. Get out, meet people, and try to get together with people for casual events which you happen to enjoy. You'll probably have more opportunities to do this with people in general as opposed to the subset of those people you'd be interested in dating, which can give you more scope to try different approaches and see what people do and don't respond to.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17786","post_title":"How to ask for dating advice?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17786","timestamp":"2018-08-21T14:09:25","char_len":3074,"word_len":552,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"You have to be very clear about your expectations about \"real, meaningful feedback\". I think most people see no benefit for themselves in telling you 100% exactly what they think about you and your performance in dating. It could lead to misunderstandings, conflicts or guilt if they go too far. Would you dare tell one of your friends he is fat\/unsexy\/a loser\/lazy\/impolite etc? The same goes for women giving you their opinion and the effect is in fact stronger in this case, because there is always the fear of being overpowered. It also makes you look desperate in their eyes and they will lose some respect. Your guy friends might also have no idea what a girl wants. Are they popular with girls themselves? Finally, is there any really objective opinion? Ask 20 people a similarly open question (not about you) and see how little their opinions will overlap. As much as I would love some of that honest feedback myself, I think it is not worth the trouble. From a first glance, it seems that you are intelligent and you pay attention to other people's responses, body language, etc. But you are trying to catch a signal (the girl's interest) in a noisy environment (irregular and half-honest feedback) by calibrating your sensors as well as possible (asking for honest feedback). There will always be some noise and this is something we have to expect. If you are always trying to reduce it, you will just perpetuate your insecurity. Instead, what I suggest is to to embrace the noise until patterns start to emerge. Find an activity that you enjoy and that involves plenty of women, just to get a glimpse of how they think and become more comfortable around them. For me, that was social dancing (salsa, swing, tango, whatever), for which there is always a shortage of men at the higher levels. You have to work together with your partner and you often have to switch partners. It might also help you with your weight loss goal. Good luck with your targets in any case.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17786","post_title":"How to ask for dating advice?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17786","timestamp":"2018-08-21T14:09:25","char_len":1982,"word_len":347,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I think the feedback from your friends is real and meaningful. If they're telling you to lose weight, then take that as a sign to double down on your existing efforts. You've already shown you can lose 30lb, and of course it's not going to happen overnight, but you'll wake up in 3 years time and the weight you are then (and the consequent effect on your dating life) will be entirely determined by the effort you put in now. Not that you have to wait till then to make meaningful improvements. Your friends have suggested that you get involved in hobbies; if you aren't sure what to do, then you should follow up. Ask if they can introduce you to some of the hobbies they take part in (and some of the girls they know through those hobbies). Lastly, you mention that you have a hard time getting feedback from girls because you tend to drop out of contact rather than getting rejected outright. A relationship is not a job interview where you get feedback at the very end; it's an ongoing process of communication. If you're meeting a girl for a first date, ask her to be honest with you during the date about whether or not she sees things going further. Reassure her that you won't take things personally, and keep a humorous attitude so that you can at least give her the impression that that's the case. Get feedback early and often. One thing that works quite well is to ask a girl what her 'type' or 'usual type' is. This gives her an easy way to tell you things she isn't keen on about you. For example, if she says that she likes really tall guys, then you might be able to tell later on that she rejected you because of your height. If she says she likes skinny guys, or guys who play sports or music, then you might get more of a picture into why you might not be fitting the requirements. With any luck, you will get a bigger picture of what girls are after, and also see that, just as all women are different, so are their tastes in men. If you've been rejected because of your height, for example, then you know that there's no kind of self-improvement you can do that will change that; you just need to find a girl who is shorter than you in heels, or who isn't looking for a super tall guy.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17786","post_title":"How to ask for dating advice?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17786","timestamp":"2018-08-21T14:09:25","char_len":2227,"word_len":418,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I think there are several different areas where you could aim to make progress. It is only based on a small amount of information, so please correct me if I am wrong. It sounds like your self-esteem, especially with respect to dating, is not very high. You don't get out enough to meet new people, and make contact with them. You are not very skilled in interactions with members of the opposite sex. These points seem quite independent, but they are actually strongly related. Improving any of these points also improves the others. If you are more confident, it is much easier to contact new people. If you are that social guy who jokes a bit with everyone at a party, girls will want to get to know you and come to you. If you enjoy life, and have a lot of fun, people want to be around you, we all want to have fun right. Maybe you can try to improve yourself in fun way. Diet can also mean eating more healthy, and you can also lose weight and improve your health with new activities\/sports. That is also a great way to meet new people and improve your social skills. Try: Registering for a cooking course and\/or club. A great way to have fun, become more healthy and meet people at the same time. Also a great activity on a date. Find nice activities or sports to do. The most important thing is that you enjoy it. Try new things, also things very different from what you usually do. You could force yourself to try something completely new every second week. It can be especially nice if you can bring a buddy with you. I am a typical guy guy, engineer, my favorite sport was kickboxing. But a friend dragged me to bikram yoga class, and I enjoyed it so much I registered. Never would have thought that, and I actually smirked and made fun of it quite a bit when she suggested it. Try some club or group to meet new people. When I moved to a new city and country I joined some groups at meetup.com. I met new people and had a lot of fun. There is something for everyone there; book clubs, wine clubs, cooking clubs and going to bars clubs. Or try some gaming related clubs, I think they are also out there. Last but not least, about social interaction with the opposite , I can highly recommend finding some information about something called the PUA, or pick-up artist community. This is a group of nerdy, analytical people, who have made it their mission to dissect the game of courting\/flirting and romance in an understandable and almost technical way. I found it very enlightening and it helped me improve my social skills and understand people much better. The book 'the game' by Neil Straus describes how he came in to contact with it, became obsessed with it and got very good at it. It also describes all the facets about it in some detail. I found it very entertaining to read too. Be a bit careful with it though, some people almost get addicted to it, and there are also some weirdo's and creeps who are in to it. Never loose yourself, and always treat other people with respect. Good luck with your quest, and most importantly, have fun!","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"17786","post_title":"How to ask for dating advice?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/17786","timestamp":"2018-08-21T14:09:25","char_len":3097,"word_len":565,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"There is no graceful way to raise the subject of obesity. Almost anyone who is overweight has had a lifetime of friends, family, acquaintances, and random strangers making sometimes well-meaning but often hurtful comments. That doesn't make for an easy conversational introduction. As for your friend, do you provide them emotional support for other issues? If so, you might add something like \"do you think your weight is a factor in that?\" -- but be careful. Obese people know damn well that their weight is a factor in romance, education, job interviews, etc. If they would like help making any practical changes (such as discussing nutrition, exercise, or accountability) then I want to provide that. Are you actually qualified to discuss these subjects? (From personal experience, it's really tiresome to get dieting advice from people who know less about nutrition than I do.) My friend has never brought it up for extended discussion. They will say things like \"I've been trying to make exercise a habit\" or \"I'm cutting back on (some food\/beverage).\" Do you think that your friend is honestly trying to be healthier and lose weight, or maybe are they feeling social pressure and shame so they make excuses and claim they are trying? (Losing weight is really really hard, and most people who try it fail. The 5% of people who count as \"successful\" at losing weight include those who keep weight off for a few years before gaining it back; a lot of overweight people have gotten discouraged about even trying.) Here are a few things you can do to be supportive: Suggest fun activities that include physical exercise within your friend's capabilities. When you are out together or with a group, make sure that there are healthy choices available -- and that means go to a restaurant that serves tasty nutritious food everyone can enjoy, not a restaurant where most people will enjoy a rich meal and a few people will conspicuously stick to a miserable dieter's meal (often overpriced relative to the food quality.) Plan social activities without alcohol, which both has a lot of calories and inhibits self-control. Instead of celebrating with food, ice cream, or booze, celebrate with movie tickets, museum passes, or other non-food treats. Suggest that you want to adopt a healthier lifestyle (something pretty much everyone in a modern society could benefit from) and ask them to be your buddy in that effort. The next time they mention wanting to do something healthier, say \"is there anything I can do to help?\" No, this is not an answer to your original question about how to provide emotional support. Emotional support from people who have never been overweight is overrated.

{"comment_text":"I have friends who, although not obese in my opinion, consider themselves to be so and are clearly not happy with their body image. The strategy I suggest here is the one that has had the better results in my experience with them. Given that your friend sometimes makes statements related to their obesity, I think it is safe for you to try and address the issue - I wouldn't recommend it if they hadn't, for it could mean they aren't prepared to discuss it yet, or even to recognize they have this problem in front of others. In order to communicate your support to your friend, I would wait until they make another remark like the ones you mentioned (\"I've been trying to make exercise a habit\", \"I'm cutting back on...\"). Then, don't say something in the same tenor of their comment, but be straightforward. Look them in the eye to convey you are serious about what you are about to say and ask something along the lines of: Do you feel very bad about your weight\/body? Be as warm as you can and then listen. I have found these direct questions to work very well. In my experience, people open up and don't seem to feel awkward about it, but relieved. If you think this is too abrupt, you can first ask for more details like in the example you gave in one of your comments (\"How is your workout routine going?\") and then go for the real question. Once your friend and you have had an open conversation about their obesity, bringing up the subject again in the future will be much easier and then you can ask if they want any concrete help from you or just emotional support when they feel discouraged. Why do I think this is a good approach? If you keep the conversation on the casual level (\"Are you following any diet?\"), to change the tone of the chat to a deeper, more serious one takes some effort and courage on their part. They might not know if you will be comfortable with them being vulnerable in front of you. However, when you are the one who takes the step, you make it easier for them to share what they are really feeling or struggling with if they want to do so. Also, I think it better to ask how they are feeling rather than if they want to have a serious conversation about their obesity, because the second feels less natural, makes the whole thing appear bigger and puts more pressure into the conversation. In the past, when someone made a remark that showed they were not confortable with their body, I would tell them they looked ok, or that they shouldn't worry so much about it, but I have noticed this doesn't help. In fact, more often that not, the person ends up being kind of ashamed of feeling what they feel. The approach above, though, makes no judgement about what they should or should not feel and gives them room for opening up to you. Hope this helps.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"19746","post_title":"How can I signal to my friend that I&#39;m open to talking about their obesity?","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/19746","timestamp":"2018-11-05T15:11:21","char_len":2818,"word_len":519,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I think that you're being too indirect. I don't know how well this advice will apply in Pakistan, but I am assuming that it's trans-cultural enough. The standard way to deflect a compliment in the U.S. is to negate it (\"No, you're too kind\" or something similar). Many people ignore compliments as well, but that doesn't express to the person giving the compliment that you would prefer they not do so and can be interpreted (here) as being somewhat rude. Negating allows you to address the compliment in conversation without accepting it at face value (which can be viewed as arrogant) or offending the person complimenting you. Trying to find out why someone made a compliment (as with the \"programming guru\" comment) might be interesting but doesn't seem practical. If your goal is to not receive such compliments it doesn't really matter if they are sincere, awkward praise, small talk, or anything else. Additionally, investigating this doesn't convey to the other person that you would prefer not to receive such a compliment. As for how to stop the compliments from coming, this is yet another case where I think that being direct is really the only option. Indirect measures, like silently ignoring a comment and hoping that the other person deciphers your silence and interprets it correctly, are difficult because you are not really expressing what you want in a way that others can be expected to interpret correctly, and so they don't really have the opportunity to behave in the way that would make you most comfortable. So what I would do is respond by saying something like \"I'm flattered that you think so much of me as a programmer, but calling me a 'programming guru' is too much. It actually makes me a bit uncomfortable because that title is so grand.\" You can also include a specific request that they not use that term, or offer an alternative, or any number of other things. But the key is that you: deflect the comment (acknowledge the sincerity, assumed or otherwise, of the speaker without accepting the compliment at face value), and clearly express to the other person that the compliments make you uncomfortable (without making it \"their fault\" that their nice gesture happened to make you feel uncomfortable).","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"4443","post_title":"How to politely repel a flattering comment","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4443","timestamp":"2017-09-22T10:36:39","char_len":2254,"word_len":379,"lang":"en"}

I am Indian myself: flattery is part of South Asian culture and in my experience persons with less social power will flatter persons with more social power. Never the vice versa. It's our duty to ourself to recognize which is a sincere compliment and which is flattery. For which we need an accurate objective understanding of our own talents and capabilities. Assuming that you do not want to tell them outright to stop flattering you, then I might suggest the following 3 options to upset the trend: (1) Just ignore -- simplest option and your job is not to give them the 'social reward' of flattery: you should not be more friendly and you can even be less friendly which means their flattery becomes useless. So they may eventually stop it. (2) Change the subject -- whenever you receive an excessive compliment, just start talking about something very different. This is a silent signal to the person that you do not welcome the flattering comments. (3) Flatter them back excessively -- that upsets the perceived social power equation of flattery and confuses the other person. Then they will understand how you feel when they flatter you! So please read all these other excellent answers, make up your mind which is the best approach for you; try it out and do give us your feedback OK!","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"4443","post_title":"How to politely repel a flattering comment","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4443","timestamp":"2017-09-22T10:36:39","char_len":1766,"word_len":301,"lang":"en"}
{"comment_text":"I've never been good at accepting compliments\/flattery either. I often thought them confusing, not really understanding why people would get it in their head to compliment me. After all, there were a lot more people in the world that were better looking\/ more skilled. (even trying to tell him politely that I daily see myself in mirror and there is nothing which you saw) comments like, \"you look handsome\", \"looking a hero today\", \"you get a lot of looks\", etc. keep on coming. I don't have supermodel looks either. So these comments used to confuse me a lot. Until I figured out that if somebody tells me I look nice today, they are probably complimenting the effort I put into my clothing, hair or makeup that day. They might even be seeing that I spent a few minutes in the sun and have a nice color on my face (not as pale as usually). I know myself and I find very embarrassed by this advanced way of pinching. I'll start with point 2, since this is the easiest: It's okay to feel uncomfortable when getting a compliment. Blush, smile, say thank you and move on. People most likely will find your reaction 'cute' (at least, that what I'm often told). There is nothing wrong with showing that you are a humble person. That said, it might be exactly this reaction that has your co-workers complimenting you. Only then, they are doing it to tease you. Teasing a person sometimes is okay, teasing you so much it borders on bullying is not. Have you tried a firm \"Stop teasing me?\". If I said, I don't like it, then it must be respected. Okay, so have clearly stated \"Stop teasing, I don't like it\" . Mentioning the word 'teasing' is important in my opinion since it conveys clearly how you think about your co-workers and their endless stream of compliments. Or you could mention that their behavior feels more like they are bullying you since the high frequency and ridiculousness of some of their compliments make you think that they aren't serious at all. You could even threaten to take this to a higher authority (manager\/boss) if they keep it up: you asked them to stop, they didn't so now it has grown into bullying. But you can't really get people to stop offering you compliments. I think this might reduce the frequency of how often you get them: You also said this yesterday\/ You have already stated this thrice this week. Please, if you want to compliment me, do it sparsely. I can't really take you seriously if you make the same compliment so often. This might work especially well if those people are just trying to make compliments\/flatter you because they want something from you\/ want you to hold them in high esteem. They want you to think well of them, so they are most likely to adhere to your wishes. That being said, unless you are very sure that they compliments are made because they know that it causes you discomfort , there is really not much you can do other than saying a quick 'Thank you' and move on.","platform":"stackexchange","post_id":"4443","post_title":"How to politely repel a flattering comment","post_url":"https:\/\/interpersonal.stackexchange.com\/questions\/4443","timestamp":"2017-09-22T10:36:39","char_len":2989,"word_len":531,"lang":"en"}

Just simple, mild social operant conditioning. It's hard to tell from text above if your coworkers are being friendly, or digging at you in some way.

{"comment_text":"Unrelated: I REALLY do not get Netflix. Blood of Zeus had 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, and instead of letting the creators do the five seasons, you obligate them to finish it in three. Season three was amazing, but come on. Why the hell do you ALWAYS cancel\/finish shows that clearly had a good acceptance? I mean, you guys never invest in marketing and then expect the series to turn into world success completely alone. That's really shitty management.","platform":"instagram","post_id":"DJuNWoGOOiM","post_title":"whatever it takes to watch WEAK HERO CLASS together","post_url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DJuNWoGOOiM\/","timestamp":"2025-05-16T15:00:00Z","char_len":450,"word_len":78,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"Netflix, you need to fix your subtitles problem when it comes to shows\/films that have both non-English and English dialogue in them. The issue is the subtitles not appearing on-screen during the moments where English is spoken. I know that I can just choose the \"English (CC)\" version of the subtitles, but I find more often than not, the closed captions and the subtitles aren't written the same; and a lot of the time, the closed captions aren't a translation, but they're a transcription of the English dub! Please have your subtitles appear on-screen at all times, regardless of which language is being spoken!","platform":"instagram","post_id":"DJuNWoGOOiM","post_title":"whatever it takes to watch WEAK HERO CLASS together","post_url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DJuNWoGOOiM\/","timestamp":"2025-05-16T15:00:00Z","char_len":615,"word_len":104,"lang":"en"}

{"comment_text":"I suspected I was stressed because of the mess in my house. Two days ago I underwent a BIA and e PPG stress flow test. It turned out that my cortisol level is steady during all the day instead of being an ascending curve in the morning and a descending one in the afternoon, as it should be. The doctor who run the test explained to me the results and recommended I get my wrists, face and nape wet with cold water when I wake up in the morning, plus having two breathing sessions every day, one before breakfast and the second before supper, plus taking two different types of supplements and sticking to circadian rhythm fasting. Decluttering would probably be less complicated, and would allow me to grow thin (or at least be less fat). The thing is, I am always tired... hope supplements and diet will help.","platform":"instagram","post_id":"DJrEpQvx8VX","post_title":"Clutter and Cortisol in Women","post_url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DJrEpQvx8VX\/","timestamp":"2025-05-16T15:00:00Z","char_len":811,"word_len":149,"lang":"en"}
